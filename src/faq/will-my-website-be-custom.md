<p class="font-41">Yes it will. That's what we recommend. We use WordPress to build custom websites that offer a wide range of features and customization options. It is open-source, making it easy to customize, and has a range of well-supported, plugins to choose from (we don't use themes typically). WordPress is also easy to use and manage, making it a great choice for those with limited web development experience.</p>

<p class="font-41">More often than not a custom WordPress build is better than using a theme or page builder like Elementor, Beaver Builder or because it allows for a more customized and unique look and feel. Building a custom WordPress website also allows for more control over the design, content, and functionality of the website, as well as the ability to add custom plugins and themes to the website. Additionally, when building a custom WordPress website, you have the ability to add custom code, which can help to create a more dynamic and interactive website. Finally, custom WordPress websites are generally more secure than websites built using elementor or beaver builder, as they are built from the ground up.</p>
