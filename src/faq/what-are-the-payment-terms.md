<p>The payment schedule is broken down into three parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>50% is due at the very beginning of the project.</li>
	<li>Another 25% is due at the first milestone, usually when design is approved.</li>
	<li>The final 25% of the total amount is due when the project is launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that there are some things that are not included in the project cost. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Production costs for printed materials</li>
	<li>Video or photography purchases</li>
	<li>Typography or font licenses</li>
	<li>Media buys, PPC or ad placements</li>
	<li>Creation of video or photography assets</li>
	<li>Hosting (this can be discussed before the project is launched)</li>
</ul>
