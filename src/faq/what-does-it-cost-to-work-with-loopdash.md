<p class="font-41">We prefer to work on a fixed-cost for a majority of our projects. To give an accurate figure, we need to understand your requirements, scope, deliverables and timelines. With that being said, most projects range from $10-20K USD and take around 4-12 weeks to deliver. The minimum level of engagement is currently set at $5K USD.
