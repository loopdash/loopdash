## Project Goals

**Visualize:** Effectively present complex data through interactive charts using Chart.js, making insights easily digestible for all visitors.

**Engage:** Incorporate responsive design elements to ensure a seamless user experience across devices, encouraging users to explore and interact with the content.

**Empower:** Utilize WordPress to create a scalable platform that allows for straightforward content updates and management, facilitating ongoing engagement and information dissemination.

## Our Recommendation

We recommend using Chart.js for data visualization. This choice enables us to style and scale the charts effectively, ensuring they are both aesthetically pleasing and easily adaptable to future needs. Additionally, we suggest implementing the website on WordPress, leveraging its flexibility and scalability to support seamless content management and updates.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Discovery (1-2 weeks)
- Determine sitemap for a 10-12 page website structure including home, about, research, news, careers, contact, reports, battlegrounds and privacy policy pages
- Establish the navigation and general website architecture
- Our style, layout, and overall approach will be user-centric, ensuring that the design, layout and architecture holistically aligns with the needs and preferences identified in the research

### 2. Data Visualization and Migration (2-3 weeks)
This phase focuses on migrating Navigator Research's historical data into interactive and updatable visualizations using Chart.js or a comparable library. The backend will be structured to support seamless data updates, ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance.

**Data Migration:** Efficiently transfer existing historical data into a format compatible with Chart.js, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

**Front-End Visualization:** Develop dynamic and interactive charts that are easily navigable and user-friendly, providing clear insights and trends.

**Backend Integration:** Design a robust backend system that allows for regular updates to data sets, supporting updates every three weeks across multiple topics.

**Design Influence:** Utilize final user research insights provided by Navigator Research to inform the design and layout of data visualizations, ensuring alignment with user needs and preferences.

**Content Integration:** Ensure all data and visual elements are presented in a manner consistent with Navigator Research's professional and data-driven brand identity.

### 3. Design (2-3 weeks)
- Develop desktop and mobile designs for all 10 pages, ensuring a professional and data-driven aesthetic
- Ensure a cohesive visual language that effectively presents data while facilitating user engagement and accessibility

**Design Process:**
- Up to two rounds of revisions per design deliverable
- Revisions will incorporate feedback related to layout, content structure, and visual elements
- Final approval of all designs is required before proceeding to development
