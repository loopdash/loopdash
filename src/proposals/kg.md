  summary: |  
    <p class="text-3 mb-10">
    Loopdash will design and develop a secure, elevated website for <strong>King Global</strong> — a banking and Swiss trust company preparing to launch by the end of 2025.  
    <br /><br />  
    The project includes a full custom website build, secure hosting environment, and Microsoft 365 setup for staff communications.  
    <br /><br />  
    Given the sensitive nature of financial and crypto services, all infrastructure will be configured for compliance, security, and reliability. Ongoing maintenance, updates, and support are included to ensure long-term stability and protection.  
    <br /><br />  
    The full project has an estimated timeline of <strong>6–8 weeks</strong> to deliver an effective and secure outcome.
