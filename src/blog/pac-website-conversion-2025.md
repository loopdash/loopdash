PAC websites need to do one thing well: convert. Whether that's signups, donations, or mobilization—your design and structure should make it frictionless.

Here's how to build a high-conversion PAC site for 2025:

## Optimize for Mobile First

Your supporters are on their phones. Make sure:

- CTAs appear within the first scroll
- Navigation is clean and clear
- Forms use large tap targets and auto-fill

A 2-second delay on mobile drops conversions by 30%.

## Donation Flows Should Feel Easy

Your donation form should:

- Offer preset amounts tied to specific outcomes (e.g. $20 = 500 texts)
- Include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, and ACH
- Highlight recurring giving without pushing too hard

## Capture Emails Everywhere

Email is still the most effective channel. Use:

- Exit-intent popups with strong value props
- Forms at the top, middle, and end of key pages
- Gated content like reports or endorsements

Even a 1% improvement in email capture compounds over a campaign cycle.

## Reinforce Trust With Design

You're asking people to give—make sure the site:

- Looks fast, clean, and credible
- Shows where the money goes
- Includes compliance info in the footer

Small trust cues add up. Especially for first-time givers.

**Final Thoughts: Form Follows Function**

PAC websites aren't about awards. They're about outcomes.

In 2025, the best sites won't be the prettiest—they'll be the ones that get the most done.
