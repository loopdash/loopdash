# Comprehensive Guide to Nonprofit RFPs - How to Source the Right Partners

A request for proposal (RFP) is more than a formality—it’s a strategic filter. When done well, it not only identifies qualified vendors but sharpens your team’s clarity around goals, budget, and capabilities.

Whether you’re sourcing a new digital agency, investment partner, CRM vendor, or strategic consultant, this guide offers structure, questions, and practices tailored to how nonprofits operate—mission-first and time-limited.

## Key Takeaways for Nonprofit Leaders

- Align your RFP with defined goals—not assumptions  
- Use examples, not templates  
- Qualify vendors based on values, not just cost  
- Score submissions using clear, measurable criteria  
- Invite innovation—but within a defined scope  

---

## Why Nonprofits Issue RFPs

For nonprofits, external partnerships are often essential—from managing endowments to launching campaigns to redesigning websites. And many boards or bylaws **require** an RFP process to ensure fairness and transparency.

Even when not required, RFPs offer value:
- Bring structure to the vendor evaluation process  
- Reveal new technologies or approaches not yet considered  
- Level-set expectations among internal teams and external partners  

> A thoughtful RFP doesn’t just compare costs—it surfaces alignment.

## Core Benefits of a Strong RFP

1. **Clarity**: Codifies your expectations, constraints, and success metrics  
2. **Efficiency**: Streamlines internal approvals and vendor comparisons  
3. **Insight**: Reveals market trends and vendor capabilities  
4. **Accountability**: Protects against vague promises or budget creep

## Step-by-Step: How to Write a Nonprofit RFP

### 1. Define Your Strategic Goals
Start with a single question: What outcome are we hiring for?

Examples:
- Increase unrestricted donations by 15%  
- Launch a multilingual WordPress site before Giving Tuesday  
- Migrate from NationBuilder to EveryAction with no data loss  

Write goals clearly. Don’t assume vendors will intuit your needs.

---

### 2. Tell Your Organizational Story
Most vendors will do research—but your own words matter.

In your overview, include:
- Mission and primary programs  
- Key audiences (e.g., donors, members, policymakers)  
- Recent achievements or growth areas  
- Internal capacity (e.g., two-person comms team, no in-house dev)

Context builds better proposals.

---

### 3. Scope the Work Thoughtfully
Your scope should reflect what you actually need—not just what’s nice to have.

Include:
- Number of pages, programs, or events involved  
- Technical requirements (CRM, email, form tools, integrations)  
- Accessibility, multilingual, or data compliance needs  
- Optional future phases (e.g., fundraising microsite, post-launch training)

> A detailed scope helps vendors quote responsibly—and protects your budget.

---

### 4. Share Your Timeline and Budget Window
Transparency invites the right partners. Include:
- RFP publish date and deadline  
- Anticipated vendor interviews (if applicable)  
- Preferred launch or completion date  
- Budget range or ceiling (ballpark is fine)

Some vendors may pass based on budget alone—and that’s a good filter.

---

### 5. Include Evaluation Criteria
Give vendors a roadmap for what matters. You might score:
- Experience with nonprofit or advocacy clients  
- Technical fit (CMS, integrations, accessibility)  
- Visual design quality or UX portfolio  
- Clarity of proposal and pricing  
- Cultural alignment or working style

Optional: assign weight (e.g., design = 30%, price = 25%, support = 15%).

---

### 6. Avoid Over-Reliance on Templates
Generic templates often fail to reflect your specific organizational needs.

If you must use one, modify:
- Scope of work
- Evaluation criteria
- Technical context
- Internal goals and constraints

> The more tailored the RFP, the more relevant the responses.

---

### 7. Invite Questions—Then Share Answers
Give vendors a short window to submit clarification questions. Publish answers (anonymously) to all invited parties to ensure fairness.

This eliminates confusion, reduces duplicate questions, and improves quality of responses.

---

### 8. Clarify Deliverables and Proposal Format
Define what you want to see in each submission:
- Executive summary  
- Team bios and relevant experience  
- Detailed scope and methodology  
- Pricing, timeline, and terms  
- Two or more nonprofit references  

Set a max page count. Clarity saves everyone time.

---

## Evaluating Your Vendor Pool

The best outcomes come from **right-sized pools**—not just volume.

- 6–10 vendors invited or discovered  
- 3–5 full proposals received  
- 2–3 interviewed  
- 1 awarded

Curate your list. Use board and partner referrals. Prioritize specialists who understand nonprofit nuances.

---
