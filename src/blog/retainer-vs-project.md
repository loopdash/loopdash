For many advocacy-driven nonprofits, working with a digital agency starts with a clear goal in mind: launch a new website, refresh branding, add a new feature. These are all project-based efforts—finite, scoped, and scheduled.

But what happens after launch?

If your site is a critical tool for engagement, fundraising, and rapid response, you may need something more ongoing. That’s where retainers come in.

Let’s explore the difference—so you can choose what fits best.

## What is a project-based engagement?

A project is a one-time collaboration. It typically includes:

- A defined beginning and end  
- A clear list of deliverables  
- Milestones, timelines, and launch goals  

Think: new website, campaign landing page, brand refresh, donation form overhaul.

Projects are ideal when:

- You know exactly what you need  
- Your internal team can take over after launch  
- You have budget set aside for a specific deliverable  

The relationship tends to pause after the work is done—until the next need arises.

## What is a retainer?

A retainer is an ongoing relationship. You set aside a monthly budget, and the agency provides support, strategy, and development time as needed.

Retainers are great for:

- Rapid response campaign updates  
- Ongoing accessibility improvements  
- Content updates and publishing  
- Analytics reviews and reporting  
- Feature enhancements and support requests  

The key benefit? You don’t have to start from scratch each time. The agency already understands your systems, tone, and mission.

> At Loopdash, we treat retainers as true partnerships. You get a dedicated strategist, flexible development hours, and faster turnaround—all with fewer emails.

## So, which one is right for you?

It depends on your stage, team capacity, and long-term goals.

**Choose a project if:**

- You’re starting fresh or doing something one-time  
- You have an internal team to maintain the site afterward  
- You prefer a fixed cost, timeline, and scope  

**Choose a retainer if:**

- You need ongoing design, tech, or strategy help  
- You want faster turnaround without repeated onboarding  
- You view your website as a living platform, not a finished product  

Some nonprofits start with a project and move into a retainer later. Others begin with a monthly agreement to maintain and evolve their digital presence over time.

## Final Thoughts

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. The best setup is the one that gives your team the support you need—when you need it.

If you're unsure, ask yourself: *What happens after launch?* If the answer feels fuzzy, a retainer might be worth exploring.

We’re always happy to talk through options and help you find the right fit—whether that’s with us or someone else.

**Let’s build something that lasts.**
