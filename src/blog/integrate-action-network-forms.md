Action Network is a trusted tool in the advocacy space—helping nonprofits manage emails, events, and signups. But when it comes to embedding their forms into your website, things can get... a little clunky.

We believe form design should feel invisible: smooth, branded, and effortless. Here's how to bring Action Network into your site—without friction or compromise.

---

## 1. Understand the Embed Options

Action Network offers three main ways to embed forms:
- **Raw HTML embed** (gives full control but requires your own styling)
- **Iframe embed** (simpler but harder to style)
- **Hosted form links** (best for quick use, less control)

For most nonprofits who want visual consistency, the **raw HTML embed** is the way to go.

## 2. Match Your Typography and Colors

Once you've embedded the form, it will likely inherit your site's base styles—assuming your CSS is set up well.

Check:
- `input`, `label`, and `button` styles
- Font stack and sizing
- Form background and padding

Apply gentle overrides only as needed. Keep things light, clean, and accessible.

## 3. Tidy the Layout With CSS

Raw Action Network forms often stack vertically, with minimal spacing.

To clean them up:
```css
.action_network form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
  max-width: 600px;
}
```
You can also use CSS Grid or media queries for responsive layouts. Always test your forms at different screen sizes.

4. Add Labels and ARIA Support
Some embedded forms arrive without full accessibility markup. You may need to:

Add aria-label attributes for clarity

Ensure all inputs have visible labels

Include proper focus states for keyboard users

Tools like axe DevTools can help with testing.

A clean form is inclusive. It respects time, ability, and attention.

5. Show Success With Intention
Action Network will display a default success message—but you can override this with your own content, animation, or redirection.

Ideas:

Show a branded confirmation with your logo and next steps

Redirect to a thank-you landing page

Trigger an email welcome series via automation

Each form submission is a micro-conversion. Treat it like a handshake.

6. Avoid Clutter—and Stay Focused
Don’t overload your form with optional fields or too many checkboxes. The simpler the form, the higher the conversion.

We recommend:

One clear purpose per form

Minimal required fields (name and email often suffice)

Clear language with no jargon

Every extra field is a point of friction.

Final Thoughts
Well-integrated forms don’t draw attention to themselves. They guide. They invite. They respect the user.

At Loopdash, we help nonprofits bring structure and subtlety to their digital infrastructure—from CRM workflows to embedded forms.
