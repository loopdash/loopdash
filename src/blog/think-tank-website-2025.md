Think tank websites are no longer just archives—they’re active tools for influence. A well-designed site helps frame the narrative, attract funders, earn media trust, and push policy into public discourse.

Here’s what every modern think tank website should prioritize in 2025:

1. **Clear Value Proposition**

   Your homepage must immediately answer: What do you do, why does it matter, and who do you do it for?

   - Use headlines that communicate impact, not jargon
   - Include a visible call to action for funders, press, or policymakers
   - Remember: if a reporter or congressional staffer visits your site, they need to “get it” in 10 seconds.

2. **Searchable, Structured Research**

   PDFs can’t be the only format. Your research should:

   - Be filterable by issue, author, and date
   - Include summaries, data visualizations, and quotable pull quotes
   - Load fast and be mobile-friendly

   If it’s not easy to skim and cite, it won’t influence policy.

3. **Expert Visibility**

   Your experts are your brand. Make it easy to:

   - Find bios, contact info, and recent commentary
   - Highlight their work on issue-specific landing pages
   - Embed media appearances and op-eds

   This builds credibility with journalists and partners alike.

4. **Funders and Fellows Matter**

   Philanthropy fuels your work. Dedicate space to:

   - Showcase fellowships and research impact
   - List institutional partners or foundation support
   - Offer easy ways to inquire about funding or partnerships

   A good site communicates stability, ambition, and ROI.

**Final Thoughts: Your Site = Your Credibility**

In 2025, your website is your platform. It's not just where you publish—it's how you're perceived.

Make it fast. Make it smart. And most of all, make it purposeful.

A nonprofit’s website isn’t just a public face—it’s often a portal for donations, volunteer sign-ups, and sensitive supporter data. With cyber threats on the rise, security isn’t optional—it’s foundational.

Whether you're running a grassroots campaign or a major nonprofit initiative, here’s how to ensure your website stays secure, trustworthy, and compliant in 2025 and beyond.

## 1. Start with the Basics: SSL, Backups & Strong Logins

Every site needs a secure foundation. That starts with:
-  SSL (HTTPS) to encrypt data between browser and server
-  Regular automated backups to recover from unexpected issues
-  Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all logins

If you’re using WordPress, tools like iThemes Security or Wordfence can help enforce login protection and monitor for threats.

## 2. Keep Software and Plugins Updated

Most breaches happen through outdated software. Whether you're using WordPress, Drupal, or another CMS:
-  Keep your core platform, themes, and plugins up to date
-  Avoid using abandoned plugins or custom code that lacks maintenance
-  Set update reminders or use tools to automate minor updates

An unpatched plugin can become the weakest link in your website’s armor.

## 3. Audit User Roles and Access Regularly

Over time, many sites accumulate unnecessary user accounts with elevated access. Make it a quarterly habit to:
-  Remove inactive users
-  Review who has admin privileges
-  Use role-based permissions to limit access only to what's needed

> Pro tip: Always use separate logins—no shared admin accounts.

## 4. Use a Reputable Hosting Provider

Your hosting environment is your first line of defense. Look for providers that offer:
-  Daily backups and malware scanning
-  24/7 support
-  Built-in firewalls or security protections

> At Loopdash, we offer managed hosting designed specifically for nonprofits and advocacy groups—with enterprise-grade uptime, proactive monitoring, and hands-on support. If you'd like a secure, hassle-free option that scales with your mission, we’d be glad to host your site.

## 5. Protect Your Donation and Contact Forms

Donation pages and contact forms are common targets. Secure them with:
-  reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha to prevent spam and bots
-  Input validation to block malicious code
-  End-to-end encryption for form submissions that include sensitive data

This is especially critical for sites that handle donor or health-related information.

## 6. Have a Clear Response Plan

Even with precautions, no system is 100% breach-proof. Prepare by:
-  Assigning a security lead
-  Documenting what to do in case of a data breach
-  Knowing who to contact (hosting, legal, etc.) if something goes wrong

A clear plan can prevent panic and mitigate damage.

## Final Thoughts: Security is Stewardship

For nonprofits, digital trust is mission-critical. Supporters, donors, and partners rely on you to protect their information.

Security isn’t about fear—it’s about stewardship. And with the right practices in place, your website can be both powerful and protected.
