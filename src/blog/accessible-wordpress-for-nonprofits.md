Accessibility is more than compliance—it’s care in design.

For nonprofits, building a website that works for everyone means reflecting the values you carry in your programs: equity, clarity, belonging. WordPress, when used thoughtfully, offers a strong foundation for this kind of inclusive digital presence.

Here’s how your organization can build an accessible WordPress website—without adding complexity.

---

## 1. Start With a Theme That Respects the Basics

Not all themes are built for accessibility. Choose one that’s:
- WCAG 2.1 compliant
- Screen reader-friendly
- Built with semantic HTML

Look for themes labeled **“accessibility-ready”** in the WordPress theme repository. These often include proper heading structure, keyboard navigation, and ARIA landmarks.

> Accessibility begins with structure—not decoration.

---

## 2. Use True Headings, Not Visual Shortcuts

Headings organize content for assistive technology. Don’t use bold text or large fonts in place of `h2`, `h3`, or `h4` tags.

Tips:
- Use only one `h1` per page
- Follow a clear hierarchy (`h2 > h3 > h4`)
- Avoid skipping levels

Well-structured headings help screen readers—and improve SEO at the same time.

---

## 3. Make Links Descriptive

Avoid vague link text like “Click here” or “Read more.” Instead:
- Use phrases like “Download our 2024 Annual Report” or “Sign the Petition”
- Ensure link color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Underline links or include a visual cue

Clear, specific links build trust and save time—especially for users with screen readers.

---

## 4. Add Alt Text With Intention

Every meaningful image should include descriptive **alt text**.

Use it to:
- Convey essential visual information
- Describe photos for users who can’t see them
- Help search engines understand your content

Skip alt text for decorative flourishes—but use it consistently for staff photos, graphics, and diagrams.

---

## 5. Ensure Forms Are Navigable by Keyboard

Donation forms, contact forms, and newsletter sign-ups must:
- Be navigable via Tab and Shift+Tab
- Include clear focus indicators
- Label fields properly with `for` and `id` attributes

Use plugins like Gravity Forms or WPForms, which offer built-in accessibility support. Test every form yourself using only a keyboard.

---

## 6. Be Thoughtful With Color and Contrast

Text should never rely on color alone. And low contrast may look “modern,” but it’s often unreadable.

Use tools like [WebAIM’s contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure:
- Text and background meet at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Buttons are visible against background colors
- Hover and focus states stand out

Design can be soft and beautiful—and still inclusive.

---

## 7. Test With Real Tools—and Real People

The best way to test accessibility is to use assistive tech or invite feedback from users with lived experience.

You can also:
- Use VoiceOver (Mac) or NVDA (Windows) screen readers
- Test in dark mode or zoomed views
- Run audits with the WAVE tool or Lighthouse in Chrome

> Accessibility is a process—not a checklist. Revisit often. Iterate gently.
