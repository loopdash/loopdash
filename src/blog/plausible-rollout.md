At Loopdash, we believe website analytics should be **simple, useful, and privacy-conscious**. That’s why we’re rolling out **Plausible Analytics** for our clients—a lightweight, privacy-friendly alternative to traditional tracking tools. Unlike platforms that rely on cookies and personal data tracking, Plausible provides key insights while respecting user privacy. It’s fast, minimal, and designed to give you clear data without unnecessary complexity. If you already use Google Analytics or another tool, this won’t be affected—Plausible runs separately and can complement your existing setup.  

If your website is part of this rollout, you’ll receive an email soon with login details. You can access your dashboard at **[analytics.loopdash.com](https://analytics.loopdash.com)**. If you’d prefer not to have analytics on your site, just let us know, and we’ll remove it.  

Our goal is to provide better insights while maintaining a privacy-first approach. If you have any questions or need assistance, we’re here to help.
