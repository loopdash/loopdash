For advocacy organizations, every pixel counts.

Your website isn’t just a digital home. It’s a platform for persuasion, education, and connection. A great WordPress theme helps you deliver that message—clearly and confidently—without distraction.

But with thousands of themes out there, where do you begin?

Here’s a calm, focused guide to finding a WordPress theme that fits your campaign, your team, and your mission.

---

## 1. Prioritize Clarity Over Complexity

Advocacy sites work best when they feel immediate. Visitors should know who you are and what you stand for—at a glance.

Look for:
- Clear typographic hierarchy (legible fonts, consistent styles)
- Ample white space
- Easy-to-scan layouts

Avoid themes with cluttered elements, carousels, or unnecessary animations. Your cause deserves clarity.

---

## 2. Make Room for Action

Petitions, emails, event sign-ups—your website needs to convert attention into momentum.

Choose themes that support:
- Prominent call-to-action (CTA) buttons
- Modular layouts for forms and embeds
- Mobile-first design, so CTAs are never buried

> A beautiful website is only powerful if it moves people to act.

---

## 3. Confirm Accessibility and Contrast

Advocacy requires inclusion. Your website must work for everyone—across devices, abilities, and connection speeds.

Seek themes that:
- Meet WCAG accessibility standards
- Offer strong color contrast between text and background
- Avoid low-contrast greys, thin fonts, or hover-only elements

Test your theme with a screen reader. Simulate colorblindness. The small steps matter.

---

## 4. Choose Lightweight and Fast

Every second counts. A fast-loading site feels polished and respectful—especially for users on slower networks.

Prefer themes that:
- Avoid bloated builders or external dependencies
- Score well on Google PageSpeed or Lighthouse
- Offer clean, semantic HTML

Speed isn’t about optimization alone—it’s part of the experience.

---

## 5. Don’t Chase Trends

Themes with parallax scrolls, typewriter effects, or mouse trails may look exciting—but they often age quickly and distract from your message.

Instead:
- Choose timeless layouts and editorial design principles
- Stick to 1–2 fonts
- Use your photography and illustrations to bring warmth

Good design supports your story. It doesn’t steal the show.

---

## 6. Look for Ongoing Support and Documentation

Many free or low-cost themes are abandoned after launch. Choose one that’s actively maintained.

Check for:
- Regular updates (especially for WordPress core compatibility)
- A responsive support team or ticket system
- Clear, well-written documentation

> A well-supported theme is a quiet asset—it saves time, prevents bugs, and keeps your site secure.

---

## 7. Consider Your Internal Team

Will your staff be editing content regularly? Is your team new to WordPress?

Then your theme should:
- Use the native WordPress block editor (no custom builders required)
- Offer reusable blocks for CTAs, updates, or success stories
- Provide a consistent editing experience across pages

Simplicity isn’t a limitation. It’s freedom.
