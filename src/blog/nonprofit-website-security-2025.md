A nonprofit’s website isn’t just a public face—it’s often a portal for donations, volunteer sign-ups, and sensitive supporter data. With cyber threats on the rise, security isn’t optional—it’s foundational.

Whether you're running a grassroots campaign or a major nonprofit initiative, here’s how to ensure your website stays secure, trustworthy, and compliant in 2025 and beyond.

## 1. Start with the Basics: SSL, Backups & Strong Logins

Every site needs a secure foundation. That starts with:
- SSL (HTTPS) to encrypt data between browser and server  
- Regular automated backups to recover from unexpected issues  
- Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all logins

If you’re using WordPress, tools like iThemes Security or Wordfence can help enforce login protection and monitor for threats.

## 2. Keep Software and Plugins Updated

Most breaches happen through outdated software. Whether you're using WordPress, Drupal, or another CMS:
- Keep your core platform, themes, and plugins up to date  
- Avoid using abandoned plugins or custom code that lacks maintenance  
- Set update reminders or use tools to automate minor updates

An unpatched plugin can become the weakest link in your website’s armor.

---

## 3. Audit User Roles and Access Regularly

Over time, many sites accumulate unnecessary user accounts with elevated access. Make it a quarterly habit to:
- Remove inactive users  
- Review who has admin privileges  
- Use role-based permissions to limit access only to what's needed

> Pro tip: Always use separate logins—no shared admin accounts.

---

## 4. Use a Reputable Hosting Provider

Your hosting environment is your first line of defense. Look for providers that offer:
- Daily backups and malware scanning  
- 24/7 support  
- Built-in firewalls or security protections

## 5. Protect Your Donation and Contact Forms

Donation pages and contact forms are common targets. Secure them with:
- reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha to prevent spam and bots  
- Input validation to block malicious code  
- End-to-end encryption for form submissions that include sensitive data

This is especially critical for sites that handle donor or health-related information.

---

## 6. Have a Clear Response Plan

Even with precautions, no system is 100% breach-proof. Prepare by:
- Assigning a security lead  
- Documenting what to do in case of a data breach  
- Knowing who to contact (hosting, legal, etc.) if something goes wrong

A clear plan can prevent panic and mitigate damage.

## Final Thoughts: Security is Stewardship

For nonprofits, digital trust is mission-critical. Supporters, donors, and partners rely on you to protect their information.

Security isn’t about fear—it’s about stewardship. And with the right practices in place, your website can be both powerful and protected.
