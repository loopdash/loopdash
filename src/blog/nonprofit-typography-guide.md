Typography is quiet power.

It’s how your words arrive before anyone reads them. For nonprofits, choosing the right fonts is not just an aesthetic decision—it’s a strategic one. The right typeface builds trust. The wrong one erodes it.

Here’s how to choose fonts for your nonprofit website that feel honest, clear, and quietly confident.

---

## 1. Choose Fonts That Reflect Your Voice

Are you bold and urgent? Calm and thoughtful? Traditional or contemporary?

Your typeface should align with your tone:
- **Humanist sans-serifs** (like Source Sans or Inter) feel warm and modern
- **Elegant serifs** (like Merriweather or Lora) evoke stability and tradition
- **Rounded fonts** (like Nunito) feel friendly and informal

> Choose fonts that speak before your words do.

---

## 2. Limit Yourself to Two Typefaces

Too many fonts create confusion and visual noise. Most nonprofits thrive with one typeface for headlines, and one for body text.

Our advice:
- Pair a bold sans-serif with a subtle serif
- Or use variations of a single typeface (e.g., Inter Light, Medium, Bold)

Simplicity builds trust. It also loads faster.

---

## 3. Ensure Excellent Readability

Design shouldn’t be decorative at the cost of legibility. Keep your text clear, open, and inviting.

Use:
- Font sizes of **16px or larger** for body copy
- Line heights around **1.5–1.8**
- Adequate contrast (4.5:1 or better)

Avoid:
- Light grey text on white
- All caps body copy
- Decorative fonts in long paragraphs

The best typography disappears—because it works.

## 4. Use Typography to Create Hierarchy

A well-designed site uses type to guide the eye.

Tips:
- Headings should be noticeably larger than body text
- Use consistent spacing above and below text blocks
- Use weight (bold, semi-bold) to distinguish—not color alone

> Your typography should tell a visual story, even without images.

---

## 5. Consider Accessibility and Load Speed

Fonts that look beautiful in Figma can slow your site down—or make it less accessible.

Choose:
- Google Fonts or locally hosted open-source fonts
- Fonts with strong diacritic and multilingual support
- System-safe backups (e.g., Arial, Georgia) as fallbacks

Use `font-display: swap` to prevent invisible text while fonts load.

---

## 6. Stay Consistent Across Channels

Your web fonts should match—or harmonize with—your brand fonts used in PDFs, emails, and print.

This builds:
- Recognition
- Trust
- A feeling of visual fluency

Typography is branding at its most intimate.
