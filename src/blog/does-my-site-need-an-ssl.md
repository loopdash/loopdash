Running a website, app or something on the internet? Having an [ssl](/glossary/ssl/) certificate is no longer treated as a luxury, but a necessity. Here are five substantial advantages of having an SSL certificate. TLDR your site must have an SSL. Continue reading below to understand why SSL is necessary.

## What is an SSL Certificate?

An SSL certificate or Secure Socket Layer Certificate encrypts digital information. It acts as a verification of an organization's identity to site visitors. Installing this allows for the use of the HTTPS protocol. SSL is primarilu used for securing data, such as credit card transactions and web form submissions, in addition to usernames and passwords. Previously, an SSL certificate was only deemed nice to have for a basic website. Now a days, Google is strongly suggesting all websites to use an SSL certificate if any information is being processed. All websites without an SSL certificate will be listed as not secure, advising site visitors not to enter any sensitive information like personal detail or credit card information on the page. SSL is crucial, for both site owners and visitors.

## What does an SSL do?

### SSL protects data

The primary purpose of an SSL certificate is to secure server-client communication. Installing an SSL means data is encrypted, locked, and can only be unlocked by the intended recipient, whether it's the browser or server. An SSL fights against hackers and skimmers fighting over sensitive information such as IDs, passwords, credit card numbers.

### SSL validates a siteâ€™s identity

SSL certificate provides authentication to a website. Identity verification is one of the most vital aspects as far as web security is concerned.

When you install an SSL certificate, you will undergo a validation process led by the Certificate Authority (CA), which verifies the identity of you and your organization. Once you have passed the process, your site will gain trust indicators to boost your page's integrity. It helps users drive to real websites, saving them from fraud and other malicious internet practices.

### SSL assists in enhanced search engine ranking

Google algorithm favors those that are HTTPS-enabled websites. Countless studies show that there is a very robust connection between HTTPS and higher search engine rankings.

### SSL supports completion of PCI/DSS requirements

If you're a site accepting online payments, you likely know about PCI/DSS requirements. To receive online payment transactions, your website must be PCI compliant. SSL certificate is one of the 12 essential requirements set by the payment card industry. Without an SSL you can't process payments.

### SSL betters customers' trust

An SSL also informs the users that the data they will give is secured; users knowing they are about to transact with a legitimate entity makes the transaction far more likely to occur. Moreover, it encourages repeated website visitation.

No matter which site you have, be it a personal blog or a ecommerce site, you need an SSL. Neglecting it will only result in loss of visitors, loss of trust, a weak online reputation, and more.
