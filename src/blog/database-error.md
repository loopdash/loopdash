If you're seeing the error message "Error establishing database connection" on your [WordPress](/glossary/wordpress/) site, it means that WordPress is unable to establish a connection to the [database](/glossary/database/) that stores all of your site's content and settings. This error can be caused by a number of different issues, but fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to try and resolve it.

### Fix Error Establishing Connection to Database

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to fix the "Error establishing database connection" error in WordPress:

1. Check if the error is still there
   Sometimes, the error may just be a temporary issue that resolves itself after a few minutes. So, the first thing you should do is to check if the error is still there by refreshing your website page or trying to access the WordPress dashboard.

2. Check your login credentials

4. Check your database server connection details

5. Repair your database
   If none of the above solutions work, the last thing to try is to repair your database. To do this, log into your web hosting account and navigate to the database administration area. Once there, locate the option to repair the database and follow the instructions provided.

6. Seek help from your web host
