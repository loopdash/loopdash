Your nonprofit’s website isn’t just a digital brochure—it’s the heart of your communications strategy. But how do you know when it’s time for a full redesign?

It’s one of the most common questions we hear, especially from growing advocacy organizations. And the answer depends less on the calendar—and more on what your audiences need today.

Let’s break it down.

## The “every 3–5 years” rule of thumb
Most experts recommend a redesign every 3 to 5 years, and for good reason:

- Technology evolves quickly
- Design trends and accessibility standards shift
- Your organization grows and changes
- User expectations rise

If your site was built 4+ years ago, there’s a good chance it no longer reflects your capacity, clarity, or credibility. But age alone isn’t always the best indicator.

## More important than age: how your site performs
Ask yourself:

- Can visitors clearly understand what we do and why we exist?
- Is the mobile experience smooth and easy to use?
- Are our forms, menus, and search tools intuitive?
- Does the backend support our team’s workflows?
- Are we proud to send people to the site?

If the answer to any of those is no, it might be time to revisit more than just a few pages.

## What to do in between redesigns
A full redesign is a big lift. But that doesn’t mean your site should sit still in the meantime. In fact, small improvements between redesigns often lead to better long-term results.

Here’s what we recommend:

- Audit your content quarterly: Is anything outdated, redundant, or missing?
- Review your analytics monthly: Are people finding what they need? Are donation or signup flows working?
- Refresh images, headlines, or homepage features seasonally
- Fix broken links and accessibility issues as you spot them
- Document internal feedback as it arises

At Loopdash, we offer retainer-based support so our nonprofit clients can make smart, lightweight changes year-round—without waiting for a relaunch.

## Signs it’s time to redesign
You probably don’t need a full rebuild every year—but if two or more of the following are true, it may be time to invest in one:

- Your branding has changed or expanded
- The CMS is outdated or difficult to manage
- Your site doesn’t meet current accessibility standards
- Mobile users are dropping off
- You’ve added programs or campaigns that the current structure can’t support
- Staff frequently rely on workarounds to publish or update content

## Final Thoughts
Your website is never really “done.” It’s a living platform that should evolve with your mission.

If it’s no longer doing its job—or holding you back from reaching the people who matter most—it might be time for a redesign. And if not, it may just need care, consistency, and a little extra love.
