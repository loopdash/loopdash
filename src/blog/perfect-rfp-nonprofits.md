Hello there! If you're part of a nonprofit, you've likely navigated the RFP (Request for Proposal) process to find the right partner for your next big project. Here at Loopdash, we respond to about 20 RFPs each year, covering creative rebrands, strategic engagements, website redesigns, and more. We know the effort it takes to craft these documents, and we're here to share some insights from our side of the table: the good, the not-so-good, and the "please avoid this."

## Clearly Define Your Needs

When it comes to crafting an RFP, clarity is your best friend. A well-defined RFP speaks volumes about your organization’s objectives and sets the stage for a successful partnership. The best agencies can spot a vague RFP from miles away, and if your objectives aren't clear, it signals uncertainty and indecision. Imagine trying to build a house without a blueprint; that’s what an unclear RFP feels like to potential partners. 

Nonprofits should strive to use specific, measurable goals in their RFPs. Avoid buzzwords that sound impressive but mean little. Instead, focus on clear, concise language that accurately reflects what you hope to achieve. For instance, stating “Increase community engagement by 15% over the next year” is far more effective than saying “Enhance community synergy.” If you're unsure of your goals or need help defining success, don’t hesitate to say so. Honesty in your RFP can attract agencies that are willing to help you define these metrics and work collaboratively to reach them.

By clearly defining your needs, you not only attract the right partners but also set the tone for a productive and transparent relationship. This clarity helps agencies understand your vision and align their proposals with your expectations, ultimately leading to a more effective partnership.

## Limit Your RFP Distribution

While it might be tempting to cast a wide net and send your RFP to as many agencies as possible, this approach can often backfire. Instead, focus on a select few firms that align with your organization’s values and objectives. Limiting your RFP distribution allows you to build more meaningful relationships and ensures that the agencies you engage with are genuinely interested in your project.

Consider pre-selecting five firms that you believe would be a good fit for your organization. Before sending out the RFP, take the time to build relationships with these agencies. Engage with them, learn about their work, and see if their values align with yours. This pre-engagement allows you to create a shortlist of firms that are not only capable but also excited about the opportunity to work with you.

Engaging a diverse range of agencies is also important for ensuring a fair and equitable process. By focusing on a smaller group, you can dedicate more time to understanding each agency’s unique strengths and how they can contribute to your project. This approach saves time and ensures you receive thoughtful, well-considered responses that are tailored to your needs.

## Engage with Interested Partners

Once your RFP is out in the world, it’s crucial to engage with potential partners who express interest. When agencies reach out, take the time to chat with them, answer their questions, and provide additional context about your project. This engagement not only helps agencies understand your needs better but also allows you to gauge their enthusiasm and fit for your organization.

Avoid adopting a purely transactional tone in these interactions. A “no vendors, please” policy can come across as impersonal and may deter potential partners who are looking for a collaborative relationship. Instead, foster open communication and be receptive to recommendations and insights that agencies might offer.

Conversations with potential partners can lead to unexpected opportunities and insights that you may not have considered. By engaging in meaningful dialogue, you create a foundation for a strong partnership built on trust and mutual respect. This collaborative approach ensures that both parties are aligned and working towards a common goal.

## Allow Adequate Response Time

Time is a valuable resource, and when it comes to RFPs, giving agencies enough time to respond thoughtfully is crucial. A rushed timeline can lead to hasty, less thoughtful proposals and may deter quality partners who value thoroughness and precision. To attract the best responses, consider giving agencies at least three weeks to submit their proposals.

This timeframe allows agencies to fully understand your needs, conduct necessary research, and craft a proposal that aligns with your objectives. It also demonstrates respect for the effort and expertise that agencies bring to the table. A well-considered proposal is more likely to address your needs effectively and provide innovative solutions that drive success.

By allowing adequate response time, you create a positive impression of your organization as one that values quality and collaboration. This approach not only attracts top-tier agencies but also sets the stage for a productive and successful partnership.

## Be Transparent with Budget

Budget transparency is a key component of a successful RFP process. Sharing your budget helps agencies tailor their proposals to your specific needs and ensures that both parties are aligned from the start. Keeping this information secret often leads to misaligned expectations and wasted time.

Consider being upfront about your budget range in the RFP. This transparency allows agencies to propose solutions that are realistic and achievable within your financial constraints. It also fosters trust and facilitates open communication, which is essential for a successful partnership.

By being transparent with your budget, you demonstrate respect for the agencies’ time and resources. This approach leads to better-tailored responses and ensures that you receive proposals that are both innovative and feasible.

## Communicate Your Schedule Clearly

When crafting an RFP, it’s important to be upfront about your project timeline. Clear communication about your schedule helps potential partners assess their capacity and plan accordingly. If you have a tight deadline, explain the reasons behind it and be open to discussions about adjusting the timeline if necessary.

Providing a realistic timeline allows agencies to allocate the necessary resources and expertise to meet your project’s needs. It also helps avoid last-minute surprises and ensures that both parties are on the same page from the outset.

By communicating your schedule clearly, you create a framework for a successful partnership that is built on transparency and mutual understanding. This clarity helps partners plan effectively and ensures that your project stays on track.

## Choose Your Words Wisely

Language plays a powerful role in shaping perceptions and setting the tone for a partnership. When crafting an RFP, consider using language that reflects a collaborative spirit. Instead of referring to agencies as “vendors,” consider using the term “partners.” This small change signals respect and sets the stage for a productive and mutually beneficial relationship.

The words you choose in your RFP can influence how potential partners perceive your organization and their role in the project. By using inclusive and respectful language, you create an environment that encourages collaboration and innovation.

Choosing your words wisely not only reflects positively on your organization but also helps attract partners who are aligned with your values and vision. This thoughtful approach to language sets the tone for a successful and enduring partnership.
