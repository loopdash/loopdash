For many organizations—whether you're running a nonprofit or growing a business—your website is one of your most valuable assets. It's often the first impression you make with potential clients, donors, customers, or community members. Choosing the right web partner isn’t just a creative decision—it’s a strategic one that can influence your success for years to come.

At Loopdash, we’ve worked with organizations of all sizes, from grassroots nonprofits to fast-moving startups and national brands. Over time, we’ve learned what tends to work—and what often gets missed early in the process.

If you’re preparing a formal RFP or simply starting to explore your options, here are some key questions to ask before hiring a web agency.

---

## 1. What platforms do you build on, and why?

Some agencies specialize in custom development. Others work with open-source or drag-and-drop platforms. It’s important to understand which content management systems (CMS) they recommend—and how that aligns with your internal team's needs.

> At Loopdash, we often recommend WordPress for its flexibility and long-term sustainability—especially for teams that want control over their content and fewer ongoing tech hurdles.

Ask:
- Is the platform open-source or proprietary?
- Will we be able to make our own updates easily?
- Are there any limitations or hidden costs?

---

## 2. What is your process—and how long will it take?

Every agency works a little differently. Some move quickly and lean, while others favor a more in-depth, research-driven process.

You’ll want clarity on:
- How long a typical build like yours takes
- What milestones or phases are involved
- What happens if things shift along the way

This helps everyone plan ahead—whether it's internal reviews, copywriting, or approvals.

---

## 3. How involved will our team need to be?

Every successful website project is a collaboration—but the level of involvement can vary.

Ask:
- Will we need to write all the content?
- How many rounds of revisions are included?
- Will you guide us on accessibility, branding, or content strategy?

Clear roles help the project move forward smoothly and keep expectations aligned.

---

## 4. What kind of training and documentation do you provide?

Once your site launches, your team should feel empowered—not dependent.

Ask:
- Will we receive training, walkthroughs, or documentation?
- Are tutorials or help videos included?
- Can we get follow-up help if we need it later?

Independence is a sign of a well-delivered project.

---

## 5. Will we fully own the website and its assets?

Ownership is critical. You should be able to move your site, switch providers, or make changes without being locked into a specific vendor or platform.

Ask:
- Who owns the design and code?
- Where will the site be hosted?
- Can we take it with us if we ever need to?

> At Loopdash, our clients fully own their websites—design, code, and content. We believe your site should always belong to you.

---

## 6. What support is available after launch?

Even the most well-built sites need updates over time—whether it's a new feature, a content change, or a quick bug fix.

Ask:
- Do you offer ongoing support plans?
- Can we get help on an as-needed basis?
- How quickly do you respond to requests?

A long-term support partner can help your website grow alongside your organization.

## Final Thoughts

A website project is more than a technical build—it’s an investment in clarity, credibility, and long-term impact. The right web partner will understand your goals, respect your constraints, and bring a structured approach to what can sometimes feel overwhelming.
