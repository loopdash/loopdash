For many nonprofits, launching a new website isn’t just a creative decision—it’s a strategic one. The website is often the first point of contact for donors, volunteers, media, and the communities you serve. Choosing the right web partner can shape how your mission is understood and supported for years to come.

At Loopdash, we’ve worked with organizations of all sizes, from small grassroots teams to national nonprofits. We’ve seen what works—and what often gets overlooked in the early stages of selecting a web agency.

Whether you're preparing a formal RFP or simply starting to explore options, here are a few thoughtful questions to ask before hiring a team to build your site.

## 1. What platforms do you build on, and why?

Some agencies specialize in custom-coded frameworks. Others lean into drag-and-drop platforms. Understanding which content management systems (CMS) they recommend—and why—can reveal a lot about their approach.

> At Loopdash, we often recommend WordPress for its flexibility and long-term sustainability, especially for mission-driven teams who want full control over their site.

Ask:
- Is the platform open-source or proprietary?
- Can we update content ourselves?
- What limitations should we expect?

## 2. What is your process—and how long will it take?

Every agency has a different rhythm. Some move quickly and lean. Others follow a more layered, research-heavy process.

You’ll want to understand:
- How many weeks (or months) are typical for a build like yours?
- What does the process look like from kickoff to launch?
- What happens if timelines shift?

Clear expectations protect both sides and help your internal team prepare for reviews, approvals, and content delivery.

## 3. How involved will our team need to be?

A successful website project is always collaborative—but the level of involvement can vary widely.

It’s important to know:
- Will you need to provide all content?
- How many rounds of feedback are included?
- Will the agency guide you through accessibility or content strategy?

The best outcomes happen when responsibilities are shared, but well-defined.

## 4. What kind of training and documentation do you provide?

After your site goes live, your team should feel confident making updates—without needing to call a developer for every change.

Ask:
- Do you provide written documentation or training videos?
- Will we receive a recorded walkthrough?
- Can we request follow-up help if needed?

Ongoing independence is a hallmark of a well-executed website.

## 5. Will we fully own the website and its assets?

Ownership isn’t always straightforward. Some agencies use proprietary systems that make it difficult to leave, move, or edit your site independently.

You’ll want to confirm:
- Who owns the code and design?
- Where will the site be hosted?
- Can we move it to another agency or server in the future?

> At Loopdash, every client fully owns their website, source files, and content. We believe your site should always belong to you.

## 6. What support is available after launch?

Even the most thoughtfully built sites will need support over time—whether it’s updates, security patches, or new features.

Ask:
- Do you offer monthly support plans?
- Is support available ad-hoc?
- How quickly do you respond to requests?

A strong support relationship helps your site evolve alongside your organization.
