<p class="mb-5"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e frequently need access to your DNS records to make a few changes. Of course, we could just login using your username and password, but that isn't necessarily the most secure option. If you use GoDaddy, like most of our customers, you can grant us access to your account. This allows us to do what we need to do, without sharing you password with us. <br/><br/>Once we have access, we are able to modifiy DNS records so we can launch your site, turn on email, or any other domain related jobs we are responsible for.
This is also more secure because you can easily revoke access once our tasks are done. </p>
