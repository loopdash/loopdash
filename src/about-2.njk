  <h1 class="text-weight-400 text-8">Something Happened to Web Development.</h1>
  <p>It used to feel personal. You worked with someone who knew your business. They understood your goals, cared about your success, and built your website like it was their own. They weren’t just a contractor — they were part of your team.
  <br /><br />
  But today? Web development is a bloated, transactional mess. Agencies bury you under layers of project managers, inflated timelines, and invoices that grow faster than your website. Freelancers? They’re affordable until they disappear, leaving you scrambling for someone new. Either way, you’re stuck juggling delays, budget surprises, and unmet expectations while your business suffers.
  <br /><br />
  It doesn’t have to be this way.
  <br /><br />
  We’re a creative web development team that operates like an extension of your business. For $4,000 a month — less than the cost of hiring a single developer — you get everything: development, design, and SEO. No endless back-and-forth. No surprise fees. Just fast, seamless support from a team that’s invested in your success.
  <br /><br />
  We don’t want a project — we want a partnership. We’re here to grow with you, taking care of your website while you focus on your business. Think of us as your in-house team without the overhead. No convoluted workflows, no disappearing acts, no nonsense.
  <br /><br />
  Web development is broken. Let’s fix it — together.
