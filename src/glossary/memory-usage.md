Memory usage refers to the amount of memory that a program or application is using at any given time. This includes both the physical memory (RAM) and virtual memory (hard drive space) that is being utilized by the program. Memory usage is an important metric to monitor, as excessive memory usage can lead to performance issues and even crashes. Developers must optimize their code to minimize memory usage, by using efficient algorithms and data structures, and by releasing memory when it is no longer needed. Memory usage can be monitored using various tools and techniques, such as profiling and memory leak detection, to ensure that the program is running smoothly and efficiently.
