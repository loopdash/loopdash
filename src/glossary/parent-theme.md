As a web developer, a parent theme refers to the main or base theme that is used as a foundation for creating a child theme. The parent theme contains all the necessary files and functionalities that are required to create a fully functional website. It includes the basic design elements, such as the layout, typography, color scheme, and other visual elements that define the overall appearance of the website. The parent theme also contains the core functionalities, such as the code that handles the navigation, widgets, and other features that are essential for the website's functionality. A child theme inherits all the features and functionalities of the parent theme, but it allows developers to customize and modify the design and functionality without affecting the parent theme. This makes it easier to update the parent theme without losing any customizations made to the child theme.
