In web development, a category refers to a grouping or classification of similar items or content on a website. Categories are used to organize and structure information, making it easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking for. For example, an e-commerce website may have categories such as clothing, electronics, and home goods. Each category would contain a list of products that fall under that specific category. Categories can also be used in blog posts to group articles by topic, making it easier for readers to find related content. In order to create effective categories, web developers must carefully consider the website's content and user needs, ensuring that categories are intuitive and easy to use.
