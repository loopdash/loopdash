As a web developer, the term Default Theme refers to the pre-designed layout and appearance of a website that is automatically applied when a new website is created. It is the basic design that comes with the website builder or content management system (CMS) and can be customized to suit the needs of the website owner. The Default Theme includes the color scheme, font styles, header and footer design, and other basic elements that make up the website's overall look and feel. It is important to note that the Default Theme can be changed at any time, and website owners can choose from a variety of pre-designed themes or create their own custom design.
