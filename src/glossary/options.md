Options refer to a feature in web development that allows users to select from a list of predefined choices. These choices can be presented in a dropdown menu, radio buttons, checkboxes, or other forms of input fields. Options are commonly used in forms, surveys, and other interactive elements on websites. They provide a convenient way for users to make selections without having to type in their own values. Options can also be customized with additional attributes such as default values, minimum and maximum values, and validation rules to ensure that the user input is accurate and valid. As a web developer, it is important to understand how to implement options effectively to create a user-friendly and efficient website.
