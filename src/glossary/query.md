A query is a request for information from a database. It is a command that is used to retrieve specific data from a database by filtering, sorting, and grouping the data based on certain criteria. Queries are essential in web development as they allow developers to extract relevant information from a database and display it on a website or application. They can be used to search for specific data, update or delete records, and perform complex calculations. Queries can be written in various programming languages such as SQL, PHP, and JavaScript, and they are an integral part of any web development project that involves data management.
