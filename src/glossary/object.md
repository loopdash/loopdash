An object is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that represents a real-world entity or concept. It is a self-contained unit that contains both data and behavior, and can interact with other objects to perform tasks. Objects are created from classes, which define the properties and methods that an object can have. The data in an object is stored in variables, also known as attributes or properties, while the behavior is defined by methods, which are functions that can be called on the object. Objects can also have relationships with other objects, such as inheritance, composition, and aggregation. Overall, objects provide a powerful way to model complex systems and enable modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
