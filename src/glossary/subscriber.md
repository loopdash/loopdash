A subscriber is a user who has opted-in to receive updates, notifications, or content from a particular website or service. In the context of email marketing, a subscriber is someone who has given their permission to receive promotional emails from a business or organization. Subscribers are typically added to a mailing list, which allows businesses to send targeted messages to a specific group of people. Subscribers can also refer to users who pay for access to premium content or services on a website, such as a subscription-based news site or streaming platform. It is important to ensure that subscribers have a seamless experience when signing up and managing their subscriptions, as well as providing them with valuable and relevant content to maintain their engagement.
