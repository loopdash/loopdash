Open Source refers to a software development model that allows the source code of a program to be freely available and modifiable by anyone. This means that the code is not owned by any particular company or individual, and can be accessed, modified, and distributed by anyone who wishes to do so. Open Source software is typically developed by a community of developers who collaborate to create and improve the software, often using online platforms such as GitHub. The benefits of Open Source software include increased transparency, flexibility, and innovation, as well as reduced costs and the ability to customize the software to meet specific needs. Many popular software programs, such as the Linux operating system and the Apache web server, are Open Source.
