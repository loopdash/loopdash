DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service, is a type of cyber attack that aims to disrupt the normal functioning of a website or online service by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In a DDoS attack, a large number of compromised computers, also known as botnets, are used to flood the target website with traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users. The goal of a DDoS attack is to cause downtime, slow down the website's performance, or even crash the server. DDoS attacks can be launched for various reasons, including extortion, revenge, or activism. As a web developer, it is important to be aware of DDoS attacks and take measures to protect your website from such attacks, such as implementing firewalls, load balancers, and other security measures.
