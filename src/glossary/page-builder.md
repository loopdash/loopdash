A page builder is a tool that allows web developers to create web pages without having to write code manually. It is a drag-and-drop interface that enables users to add and arrange various elements such as text, images, videos, and widgets on a web page. Page builders come with pre-designed templates and layouts that can be customized to suit the user's needs. They also offer a wide range of design options, including font styles, colors, and backgrounds. With a page builder, web developers can create professional-looking web pages quickly and easily, without the need for extensive coding knowledge. This tool is especially useful for those who want to create websites quickly or for those who do not have the budget to hire a professional web developer.
