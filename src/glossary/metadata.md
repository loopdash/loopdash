Metadata refers to the information that describes other data. It provides context and additional details about a particular piece of data, such as its format, author, date created, and keywords. Metadata is used to help organize and manage data, making it easier to find and use. It is commonly used in web development to improve search engine optimization (SEO) by providing search engines with information about the content of a website. Metadata can also be used to improve accessibility by providing information about the structure and content of a web page to assistive technologies. Overall, metadata plays a crucial role in making data more useful and accessible.
