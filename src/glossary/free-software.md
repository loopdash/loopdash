Free software refers to computer software that is distributed with the freedom to use, modify, and distribute it without any restrictions. This means that users have the freedom to run the software for any purpose, to study how it works, to modify it to suit their needs, and to distribute copies of the software to others. Free software is often associated with the open-source movement, which promotes collaboration and transparency in software development. The concept of free software is based on the idea that software is a tool for empowering users, rather than a commodity to be sold for profit. Free software is often used in academic and research settings, as well as by individuals and organizations who value the freedom to control their own computing environment.
