As a web developer, localhost refers to the local computer or server that is being used to develop and test a website or web application. It is a loopback address that points to the computer's own network interface, allowing developers to access their own web server without the need for an internet connection. This means that developers can test their website or application in a safe and controlled environment before deploying it to a live server. Localhost is often used in conjunction with a web server software such as Apache or Nginx, which allows developers to create a local web server on their own machine. This enables them to test and debug their code, make changes and updates, and ensure that their website or application is functioning correctly before it goes live.
