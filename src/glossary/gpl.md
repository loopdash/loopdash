GPL, or the GNU General Public License, is a widely used open-source software license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software. The GPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open, and that users have the freedom to modify and improve it as they see fit. Under the GPL, anyone can access the source code of a software program, modify it, and distribute it to others. However, any modifications or derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL, ensuring that the software remains open and free for all. The GPL is a powerful tool for promoting collaboration and innovation in the software industry, and has been used to create some of the most popular and widely used software programs in the world.
