A visual editor is a web development tool that allows users to create and edit web pages visually, without the need for coding knowledge. It provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to drag and drop elements onto a canvas, customize their appearance, and arrange them in a layout that suits their needs. Visual editors typically offer a wide range of pre-designed templates, themes, and widgets that users can choose from to create their web pages quickly and easily. They also provide real-time previews of the web page as it is being designed, allowing users to see how their changes will look before publishing. Overall, visual editors are an essential tool for web developers who want to create professional-looking web pages quickly and efficiently.
