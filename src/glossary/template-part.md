A template part is a reusable piece of code that can be used in multiple templates or pages of a website. It is a way to simplify the process of creating and maintaining a website by allowing developers to create a single piece of code that can be used in multiple places. Template parts can include anything from headers and footers to navigation menus and sidebars. They are typically created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of a website. By using template parts, web developers can save time and effort while ensuring consistency and uniformity across their website.
