A contributor can be anyone who contributes to the project by providing code, documentation, bug fixes, or any other form of support. They are an essential part of the development process, as they help to improve the quality of the project by providing valuable feedback and suggestions.

In open-source projects, contributors are often recognized and rewarded for their contributions, which can include access to the project's source code, recognition on the project's website, or even financial compensation.
