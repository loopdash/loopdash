Hooks are a feature in React that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. They are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, and they allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. Hooks can be used to manage state, handle side effects, and more. They are a powerful tool that can help you write cleaner, more efficient code. With Hooks, you can create reusable components that are easy to understand and maintain. Overall, Hooks are a valuable addition to the React library that make it easier to write complex applications.
