A fluid layout is a web design technique that allows the content of a website to adjust and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This means that the website will look great on any device, whether it's a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. The layout is designed to be flexible, with elements such as images, text, and navigation menus resizing and repositioning themselves to fit the available space. This is achieved by using percentages instead of fixed pixel values for the width and height of elements, allowing them to expand or contract as needed. A fluid layout is an essential aspect of responsive web design, which aims to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.
