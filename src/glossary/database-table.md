A database table is a structured collection of data that is organized into rows and columns. It is a fundamental component of a relational database management system (RDBMS) and is used to store and manage data in a structured and efficient manner. Each table in a database is designed to hold data related to a specific entity or concept, such as customers, orders, or products. The columns in a table represent the different attributes or characteristics of the entity, while the rows represent individual instances or records of that entity. Tables can be linked together through relationships, allowing for complex queries and data analysis. Properly designing and maintaining database tables is crucial for ensuring data integrity, accuracy, and consistency.
