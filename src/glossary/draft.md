As a web developer, the term "draft" refers to a preliminary version of a website or web page that is still in the process of being developed. A draft is typically created during the early stages of the web development process, and serves as a rough outline or blueprint for the final product. During this stage, the developer may experiment with different design elements, layouts, and content to determine what works best for the website's intended purpose. Once the draft is complete, it can be reviewed and revised as necessary before moving on to the next stage of development. Overall, the draft is an essential part of the web development process, as it allows the developer to refine their ideas and create a solid foundation for the final product.
