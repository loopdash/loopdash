Nonce is a term used in web development that stands for "number used once". It is a unique and random value that is generated by a server and sent to a client as part of a security protocol. The purpose of a nonce is to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts and reuses a previously valid request. By including a nonce in each request, the server can verify that the request is legitimate and has not been tampered with. Nonces are commonly used in authentication and authorization protocols, such as OAuth and OpenID Connect, to ensure secure communication between clients and servers.
