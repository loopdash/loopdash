A sidebar is a vertical column that appears on the side of a webpage, typically on the left or right-hand side. It is a common design element used in websites to display additional information or navigation options that are not part of the main content. The sidebar can contain various widgets, such as search bars, social media links, recent posts, categories, tags, and advertisements. It is an effective way to organize and present information in a visually appealing manner, without cluttering the main content area. The sidebar can be fixed or scrollable, depending on the website's design and functionality. Overall, the sidebar is a useful tool for web developers to enhance the user experience and improve website navigation.
