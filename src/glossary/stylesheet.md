A stylesheet is a set of rules or instructions that define the visual appearance of a web page. It is a document that contains information about how elements on a web page should be displayed, such as font size, color, spacing, and layout. Stylesheets are written in a language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and are used to separate the presentation of a web page from its content. This allows web developers to easily make changes to the appearance of a website without having to modify the HTML code. Stylesheets can be applied to a single web page or to an entire website, making it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages.
