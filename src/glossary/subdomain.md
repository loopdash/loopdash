A subdomain is a part of a larger domain name that is used to organize and categorize content on a website. It is a prefix that is added to the main domain name and separated by a dot. For example, if the main domain name is "example.com", a subdomain could be "blog.example.com" or "shop.example.com". Each subdomain can have its own unique content, design, and functionality, but it is still part of the same website and shares the same root domain. Subdomains are commonly used to create separate sections for different types of content, such as blogs, forums, or e-commerce stores, and can also be used to create language-specific versions of a website.
