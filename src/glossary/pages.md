Pages refer to the individual sections or components of a website that contain specific information or content. These can include home pages, about pages, product pages, blog posts, and more. Each page is designed to serve a specific purpose and provide users with relevant information or functionality. Pages are typically organized into a hierarchical structure, with the home page serving as the main entry point and other pages linked to it. Web developers must carefully consider the layout, design, and content of each page to ensure that it is user-friendly, visually appealing, and optimized for search engines. Additionally, pages must be responsive and accessible across different devices and platforms to ensure a seamless user experience.
