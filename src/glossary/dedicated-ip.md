A dedicated IP is a unique internet protocol (IP) address that is exclusively assigned to a single website or server. Unlike shared IP addresses, which are used by multiple websites, a dedicated IP provides a website with its own unique identity on the internet. This means that the website can be accessed directly through its IP address, rather than through a shared IP address that may be associated with other websites. Dedicated IPs are often used by businesses that require secure connections, such as e-commerce sites that process sensitive customer information. They also allow for more control over website performance and can improve search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.
