Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer or mobile device when they visit a website. These files contain information about the user's browsing activity on the website, such as their preferences, login information, and shopping cart contents. Cookies are used by websites to personalize the user experience, remember user preferences, and track user behavior for analytics purposes. They can also be used for targeted advertising and retargeting campaigns. Cookies can be either first-party, which are set by the website the user is visiting, or third-party, which are set by a different website that provides content or services on the original website. While cookies can be useful for improving the user experience, they can also raise privacy concerns, as they can be used to track user activity across multiple websites.
