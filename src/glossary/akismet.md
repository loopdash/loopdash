Akismet is a web-based spam filtering service that is designed to protect websites from unwanted comments and spam. It is a plugin that is commonly used on WordPress websites to automatically detect and filter out spam comments. Akismet uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze comments and determine whether they are spam or not. It works by comparing the content of the comment to a vast database of known spam comments and patterns. If a comment is identified as spam, it is automatically moved to the spam folder, preventing it from being published on the website. Akismet is an essential tool for any website owner who wants to maintain a clean and spam-free website.
