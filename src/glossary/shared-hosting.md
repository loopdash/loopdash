Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service where multiple websites are hosted on a single server. In this type of hosting, the server resources such as CPU, RAM, and disk space are shared among all the websites hosted on the server. This makes shared hosting an affordable option for small businesses and individuals who are just starting out with their online presence. However, since the resources are shared, the performance of one website can affect the performance of other websites on the same server. Additionally, shared hosting may have limitations on the amount of traffic, storage, and bandwidth that can be used by each website. Overall, shared hosting is a cost-effective option for those who need basic website hosting services and do not require high levels of customization or control over their server.
