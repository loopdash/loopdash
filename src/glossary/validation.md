Validation is the process of checking whether the data entered by the user is correct and meets the required standards. In web development, validation is an essential step to ensure that the user inputs are accurate, complete, and consistent. It involves verifying the data against a set of predefined rules and constraints, such as data type, length, format, and range. Validation can be performed on both the client-side and server-side of the web application. Client-side validation is done using JavaScript, while server-side validation is done using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. Validation helps to prevent errors, improve data quality, and enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback to the user if the input is incorrect.
