Responsive Design

Responsive design is a web development approach that aims to create websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This means that the website will look and function properly on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Responsive design involves using flexible layouts, images, and media queries to adjust the website's content and layout based on the user's device. This approach is essential in today's digital landscape, where users access websites from a variety of devices and screen sizes. By implementing responsive design, web developers can ensure that their websites are accessible and user-friendly for all visitors, regardless of the device they are using.
