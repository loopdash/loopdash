Comments are an essential part of any programming language, including web development. They are lines of code that are ignored by the browser and are used to add notes or explanations to the code. Comments are used to make the code more readable and understandable for other developers who may work on the same project. They can also be used to temporarily disable a piece of code without deleting it entirely. Comments can be added in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using different syntaxes. In HTML, comments are enclosed in <!-- and -->, while in CSS, they are enclosed in /_ and _/. In JavaScript, comments can be added using // for single-line comments and /_ and _/ for multi-line comments. Overall, comments are a crucial tool for web developers to improve the quality and maintainability of their code.
