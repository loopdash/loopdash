Dedicated hosting refers to a type of web hosting service where a client is provided with a physical server that is exclusively dedicated to their website or application. This means that the client has complete control over the server's resources, including CPU, RAM, and storage, and can configure it to meet their specific needs. Dedicated hosting is ideal for websites or applications that require high levels of performance, security, and reliability, as it provides a dedicated environment that is not shared with other users. Additionally, dedicated hosting allows clients to install and run custom software, as well as to manage their own security and backups. While dedicated hosting is typically more expensive than shared hosting, it offers a higher level of control and flexibility, making it a popular choice for businesses and organizations with complex hosting requirements.
