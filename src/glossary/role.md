A role in web development refers to a set of permissions and responsibilities assigned to a user or group of users within a website or web application. These roles are typically defined by the website administrator or developer and are used to control access to certain features or content on the site. For example, a user with an "admin" role may have the ability to create and edit content, while a user with a "guest" role may only be able to view content. Roles can also be used to assign specific tasks or responsibilities to different users, such as managing user accounts or moderating comments. Overall, roles are an important tool for ensuring that website users have the appropriate level of access and control over the site's content and functionality.
