A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. It is a central repository that stores data in a structured format, making it easy to access and manage. Databases are used in a wide range of applications, from simple contact lists to complex enterprise systems. They are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide a way to store, organize, and retrieve information quickly and efficiently. Databases can be relational or non-relational, and they can be hosted on-premises or in the cloud. They are an essential component of modern web development, providing a way to store and manage data for web applications.
