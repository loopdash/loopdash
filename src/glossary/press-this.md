Press This is a feature in WordPress that allows users to quickly and easily create new posts or pages from any web page they are currently viewing. It is a bookmarklet that can be added to the browser's bookmarks bar, and when clicked, it opens a pop-up window with the content of the current page. From there, users can edit the content, add tags and categories, and publish the post or page directly from the Press This window. This feature is particularly useful for bloggers and content creators who want to quickly share interesting articles or media they come across while browsing the web.
