Front End refers to the part of a website or application that is visible and accessible to the user. It includes the design, layout, and functionality of the user interface, as well as the code that runs in the user's browser. Front End developers are responsible for creating and implementing the visual and interactive elements of a website or application, using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They work closely with designers to ensure that the user experience is intuitive and engaging, and with Back End developers to ensure that the Front End and Back End systems are integrated seamlessly. A well-designed Front End is essential for creating a positive user experience and encouraging user engagement.
