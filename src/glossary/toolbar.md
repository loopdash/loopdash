A toolbar is a graphical user interface element that contains a set of icons or buttons that provide quick access to frequently used functions or commands within a software application or web browser. Toolbars are typically located at the top of the application or browser window and can be customized by the user to include only the buttons they need. They can also be hidden or displayed as needed. Toolbars can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as navigating to a specific website, searching for content, adjusting settings, or accessing frequently used tools. They are a convenient and efficient way to streamline workflow and improve productivity.
