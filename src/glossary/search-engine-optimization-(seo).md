Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves various techniques and strategies that aim to increase the quantity and quality of organic traffic to a website. SEO includes on-page optimization, such as optimizing website content, meta tags, and images, as well as off-page optimization, such as link building and social media marketing. The ultimate goal of SEO is to improve a website's relevance and authority in the eyes of search engines, which can lead to higher rankings, more traffic, and ultimately, more conversions and revenue. Effective SEO requires a deep understanding of search engine algorithms, user behavior, and industry trends, as well as ongoing monitoring and optimization to stay ahead of the competition.
