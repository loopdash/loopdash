As a web developer, a slug refers to a part of a URL that identifies a specific page or post on a website. It is a user-friendly and search engine optimized version of the page or post title, which is used to create a unique URL for each page or post. The slug typically consists of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and it is used to make the URL more readable and memorable for users. It is important to choose a descriptive and concise slug that accurately reflects the content of the page or post, as it can impact the website's search engine ranking and user experience.
