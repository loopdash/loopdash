Backend refers to the part of a website or application that is responsible for managing and processing data. It is the server-side of the website that is not visible to the user. The backend is responsible for handling tasks such as database management, server-side scripting, and API integration. It is the backbone of any website or application, as it ensures that the website or application runs smoothly and efficiently. The backend is typically developed using programming languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java. A web developer must have a strong understanding of backend development to create a functional and effective website or application.
