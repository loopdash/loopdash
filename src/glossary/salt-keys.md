SALT keys are a crucial component of web development that are used to enhance the security of user passwords. SALT stands for "Securely Additive and Locally Unique Tokens," and refers to a random string of characters that is added to a user's password before it is hashed and stored in a database. This process makes it much more difficult for hackers to crack passwords using brute force attacks or other methods. SALT keys are typically generated using a cryptographic algorithm and are unique to each user, ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different. As a web developer, it is important to understand the importance of SALT keys and to implement them properly in order to protect user data and maintain the integrity of your website.
