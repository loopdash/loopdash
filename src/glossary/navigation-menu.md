A navigation menu is a graphical user interface element that allows users to navigate through a website or application. It typically appears at the top of a webpage and contains links to various pages or sections of the site. Navigation menus can be designed in a variety of ways, including drop-down menus, hamburger menus, or tabbed menus. The purpose of a navigation menu is to provide users with a clear and intuitive way to access the content they are looking for. A well-designed navigation menu should be easy to use, visually appealing, and organized in a logical manner. It should also be responsive, meaning it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Overall, a navigation menu is a crucial component of any website or application, as it helps users find the information they need quickly and efficiently.
