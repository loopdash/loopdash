URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is a unique address that identifies a specific resource on the internet. It is a string of characters that includes the protocol, domain name, and path to a specific web page or file. The protocol is the method used to access the resource, such as HTTP or HTTPS. The domain name is the unique name that identifies the website, and the path is the specific location of the resource on the server. URLs are essential for navigating the internet and accessing web pages, images, videos, and other resources. They are also used for search engine optimization and link building strategies. A well-structured URL can improve the user experience and make it easier for search engines to crawl and index web pages.
