SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol that is used to establish a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a web browser. It is a standard security technology that ensures that all data transmitted between the server and the browser remains private and secure. SSL works by encrypting the data that is transmitted between the server and the browser, making it impossible for anyone to intercept or read the data. This is particularly important for websites that handle sensitive information such as credit card details, login credentials, and personal information. SSL certificates are issued by trusted third-party organizations and are used to verify the identity of the website and ensure that the connection is secure. Overall, SSL is an essential component of web security and is crucial for protecting the privacy and security of users online.
