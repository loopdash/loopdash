In web development, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows developers to create reusable code and organize their code into logical units. A class can contain variables, methods, and constructors that define the attributes and actions of an object. It provides a way to encapsulate data and functionality, making it easier to manage and maintain code. Classes can be inherited, allowing developers to create new classes that inherit the properties and behaviors of existing classes. Overall, classes are a powerful tool for creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code in web development.
