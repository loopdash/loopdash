SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase the quantity and quality of organic traffic to a website by improving its relevance and authority in the eyes of search engines. This involves a variety of techniques, including keyword research, on-page optimization, link building, and content creation. By implementing effective SEO strategies, web developers can help their clients attract more visitors, generate more leads, and ultimately increase their revenue. However, it's important to note that SEO is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adjustment to stay ahead of the competition and maintain a strong online presence.
