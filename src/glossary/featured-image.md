A featured image is a visual representation of a post or page on a website that is used to grab the attention of the viewer. It is typically displayed at the top of the post or page and is often larger than other images on the site. The featured image is also used as a thumbnail image when the post or page is shared on social media or other platforms. It is an important element of web design as it can help to make a post or page more visually appealing and engaging to the viewer. The featured image can be customized to fit the style and theme of the website, and can be changed or updated as needed to keep the content fresh and relevant.
