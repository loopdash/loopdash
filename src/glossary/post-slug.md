As a web developer, a post slug refers to the part of a URL that identifies a specific post or page on a website. It is a user-friendly and search engine optimized version of the post or page title, which is used to create a unique URL for each post or page. The post slug is typically created by removing any special characters, spaces, and capital letters from the post or page title and replacing them with hyphens. This makes the URL more readable and easier to remember for users, while also improving the website's search engine ranking by including relevant keywords in the URL. In summary, the post slug is an essential component of a website's URL structure that helps to improve user experience and search engine optimization.
