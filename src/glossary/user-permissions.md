User permissions refer to the level of access and control that a user has over a particular system or application. In web development, user permissions are used to define the actions that a user can perform within a website or web application. These permissions can range from basic read-only access to full administrative control, depending on the user's role and responsibilities. User permissions are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of a web application, as they ensure that users only have access to the features and data that they are authorized to use. It is important to carefully design and implement user permissions to ensure that users can perform their tasks efficiently and securely, while also protecting the system from unauthorized access or misuse.
