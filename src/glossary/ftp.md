FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over the internet. It is a client-server protocol, which means that one computer acts as the client and the other as the server. The client computer connects to the server using an FTP client software, which allows the user to browse and transfer files between the two computers. FTP is commonly used by web developers to upload and download files to and from web servers, such as HTML files, images, and scripts. It is a reliable and efficient way to transfer large files and is widely supported by most operating systems and web hosting providers. However, FTP is not secure as it transmits data in plain text, which can be intercepted by hackers. As a result, it is recommended to use secure alternatives such as SFTP or FTPS for sensitive data transfers.
