Post meta refers to the additional information that can be attached to a WordPress post. This information can include things like the author of the post, the date it was published, and any tags or categories that have been assigned to it. Post meta can also include custom fields, which allow developers to add their own custom data to a post. This data can be used to display additional information about the post, such as a custom image or a list of related posts. Post meta is an important part of WordPress development, as it allows developers to create more complex and dynamic websites that can be customized to meet the needs of their clients.
