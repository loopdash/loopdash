This file is located in the root directory of a WordPress installation and is responsible for connecting the site to the database, defining the database name, username, and password, and setting up security keys and salts. Additionally, wp-config.php allows developers to define custom settings, such as debugging options, language settings, and file permissions. Overall, wp-config.php is a vital component of any WordPress site, and developers must ensure that it is properly configured to ensure the site's stability and security.
