iFrame, short for inline frame, is an HTML element that allows you to embed another HTML document within the current page. It is essentially a window into another web page that can be displayed on your own website. iFrames are commonly used to display content from third-party websites, such as videos, maps, or social media feeds, without the need to redirect the user to another page. They are also useful for creating modular web pages, where different sections of the page can be loaded independently, without affecting the rest of the content. iFrames can be customized with various attributes, such as size, scrolling, and border, to fit seamlessly into the design of your website. However, it is important to note that iFrames can pose security risks if not used properly, as they can be used to inject malicious code or phishing attacks.
