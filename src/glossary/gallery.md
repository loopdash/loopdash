A gallery is a web page or section of a website that displays a collection of images or videos. It is a visual representation of a collection of items that can be viewed by visitors to the website. Galleries can be used to showcase artwork, photographs, products, or any other type of visual content. They can be organized in various ways, such as by category, date, or popularity. Galleries can also include features such as zooming, scrolling, and filtering to enhance the user experience. A well-designed gallery can be an effective way to engage visitors and showcase the best of what a website has to offer.
