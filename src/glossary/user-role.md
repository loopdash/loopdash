User Role refers to the specific set of permissions and access levels assigned to a user within a website or application. User roles are typically defined by the website administrator or developer and can vary depending on the type of website or application. For example, a user role in an e-commerce website may include the ability to view products, add items to a cart, and make purchases, while a user role in a social media platform may include the ability to create and share content, comment on posts, and connect with other users. User roles are important for maintaining website security and ensuring that users only have access to the features and information that are relevant to their needs.
