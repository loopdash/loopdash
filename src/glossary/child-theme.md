A child theme is a WordPress theme that inherits all the functionality and styling of its parent theme but allows for customization without affecting the original theme. It is essentially a separate theme that is built on top of the parent theme and can be used to modify the appearance and functionality of the website. Child themes are useful for making changes to a theme without losing any of the original code or functionality. They are also helpful for updating the parent theme without losing any customizations made to the child theme. Child themes are easy to create and can be used to add new features, modify existing ones, or change the design of a website.
