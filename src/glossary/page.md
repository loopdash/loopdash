A page in web development refers to a single document or file that contains information, text, images, and other multimedia elements that are displayed on a website. Pages are the building blocks of a website and are typically accessed through hyperlinks or navigation menus. Each page has a unique URL that allows users to access it directly. Pages can be static or dynamic, depending on the content and functionality they provide. Static pages are pre-built and do not change unless manually updated, while dynamic pages are generated on the fly and can change based on user input or other factors. Pages are designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for search engines to ensure maximum visibility and engagement.
