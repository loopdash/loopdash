An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet. It serves as a means of identifying and communicating with devices on a network, allowing data to be transmitted between them. IP addresses are composed of four sets of numbers separated by periods, with each set ranging from 0 to 255. They can be either static, meaning they remain the same over time, or dynamic, meaning they change periodically. IP addresses are essential for internet communication, as they enable devices to locate and connect with each other across the vast network of interconnected devices that make up the internet.
