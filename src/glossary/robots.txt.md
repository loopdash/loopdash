Robots.txt is a file that is placed in the root directory of a website to instruct search engine crawlers on which pages or sections of the website should not be crawled or indexed. It is a simple text file that contains a set of rules that tell search engine bots which pages or directories to exclude from their indexing process. The robots.txt file is an essential tool for web developers and website owners to control the visibility of their website content in search engine results pages. By using robots.txt, web developers can prevent search engines from indexing sensitive or confidential information, duplicate content, or pages that are not relevant to search queries. It is important to note that robots.txt is not a security measure and should not be used to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
