An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. It is a fundamental concept in programming and is used extensively in web development. Arrays are commonly used to store lists of data such as numbers, strings, or objects. Each element in an array is identified by an index, which is a numeric value that represents its position in the array. The first element in an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. Arrays are versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as sorting, searching, and manipulating data. They are an essential tool for web developers and are used in many programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
