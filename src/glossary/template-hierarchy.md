Template Hierarchy is a term used in web development that refers to the order in which WordPress searches for and selects the appropriate template file to display a particular page or post on a website. The hierarchy is based on the type of content being displayed, such as a single post, a category archive, or a search result page. The system starts with the most specific template file and works its way up to the most general until it finds a suitable match. This allows developers to create custom templates for specific types of content and ensures that the correct template is used for each page or post on the website. Understanding the Template Hierarchy is essential for creating custom WordPress themes and ensuring that the website functions correctly.
