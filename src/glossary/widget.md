A widget refers to a small application or tool that can be embedded into a website or a web page. It is designed to perform a specific function, such as displaying weather updates, social media feeds, or search boxes. Widgets are typically created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be customized to match the look and feel of the website they are being added to. They are often used to enhance the user experience by providing quick access to information or functionality without the need to navigate away from the current page. Widgets can be either static or dynamic, and can be added to a website using a variety of methods, including code snippets, plugins, or third-party services.
