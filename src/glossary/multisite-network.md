A Multisite Network is a feature in WordPress that allows a single installation of WordPress to host multiple websites or blogs. It enables users to create and manage multiple sites from a single dashboard, making it easier to manage and maintain multiple websites. Each site in the network can have its own unique domain name, content, and design, but they all share the same WordPress installation, plugins, and themes. This feature is particularly useful for businesses, organizations, or individuals who want to manage multiple websites with different content, but don't want to go through the hassle of installing and maintaining separate WordPress installations for each site. With Multisite Network, users can easily create new sites, manage users, and control access to different sites within the network.
