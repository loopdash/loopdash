A template is a pre-designed layout or structure that serves as a starting point for creating a website or web page. It is a framework that defines the overall look and feel of a website, including the placement of content, images, and other design elements. Templates can be customized to suit the specific needs of a website, such as the type of content being displayed or the target audience. They are often used to save time and effort in the web development process, as they provide a basic structure that can be easily modified and updated as needed. Templates can be created using a variety of tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be downloaded from various sources, such as online marketplaces or web development platforms.
