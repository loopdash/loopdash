A subfolder is a folder that is located within another folder. It is a way of organizing files and folders within a directory structure. Subfolders can be created within a main folder to group related files together, making it easier to find and manage them. For example, if you have a main folder for your website, you can create subfolders for images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. This helps to keep your files organized and makes it easier to locate them when you need to make changes or updates to your website. Subfolders can also be used to create a hierarchy of folders, with subfolders within subfolders, allowing for even more organization and structure.
