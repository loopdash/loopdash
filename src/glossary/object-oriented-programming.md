Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent real-world entities and concepts. In OOP, objects are created from classes, which define the properties and behaviors of the objects. The properties of an object are represented by its attributes, while its behaviors are represented by its methods. OOP allows for encapsulation, which means that the internal workings of an object are hidden from the outside world, and inheritance, which allows for the creation of new classes based on existing ones. OOP is widely used in modern programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++. It provides a modular and reusable approach to programming, making it easier to maintain and update code over time.
