A configuration file, also known as a config file, is a file that contains settings and parameters that are used to configure a software application or system. It is a plain text file that is typically stored in a specific location on a computer or server, and it can be edited using a text editor or a specialized configuration tool. The purpose of a config file is to provide a centralized location for storing configuration settings that can be easily modified without having to modify the source code of the application or system. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the software, as well as to deploy it across multiple environments. Config files can contain a wide range of settings, including database connection strings, server addresses, security settings, and more. They are an essential component of modern software development and are used in a wide range of applications, from web servers to desktop applications.
