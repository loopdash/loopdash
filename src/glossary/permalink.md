A permalink, short for "permanent link," is a URL that points to a specific page or post on a website. It is a unique and permanent link that remains unchanged even if the content of the page or post is updated or moved. Permalinks are important for search engine optimization (SEO) as they help search engines to index and rank the content of a website. They also make it easier for users to share and bookmark specific pages or posts on social media platforms or other websites. Permalinks can be customized to include keywords or other relevant information to make them more descriptive and user-friendly.
