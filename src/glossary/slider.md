A slider is a graphical user interface element that allows users to select a value from a range of values by sliding a knob or handle along a track. Sliders are commonly used in web development to create interactive and engaging interfaces for users. They are often used to control the volume of audio or video, adjust the brightness or contrast of an image, or select a value from a range of options. Sliders can be customized to match the design of a website or application, and can be programmed to respond to user input in a variety of ways. They are a versatile and useful tool for web developers looking to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.
