In web development, a method refers to a function or procedure that is used to perform a specific action or task. Methods are an essential part of programming languages and are used to manipulate data, interact with the user, and perform various operations on web pages. They are typically defined within classes or objects and can be called upon to execute a specific set of instructions. Methods can take parameters, which are values passed to them when they are called, and can also return values, which are the results of their execution. Some common methods used in web development include GET and POST methods for sending and receiving data from servers, as well as methods for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update web pages.
