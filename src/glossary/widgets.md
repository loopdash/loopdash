Widgets are small, self-contained applications that can be embedded into a website or a mobile application. They are designed to provide specific functionality or information to the user, such as a weather forecast, a news feed, or a search bar. Widgets are typically easy to use and require minimal configuration, making them a popular choice for website owners who want to enhance their site's functionality without having to write custom code. They can be created using a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and can be customized to match the look and feel of the website or application they are embedded in. Widgets are a powerful tool for web developers, as they can help to improve user engagement and provide a more seamless user experience.
