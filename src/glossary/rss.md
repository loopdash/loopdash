RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, which is a web feed format used to publish frequently updated content such as blog posts, news articles, and podcasts. It allows users to subscribe to a website's RSS feed and receive updates automatically in their RSS reader or aggregator. RSS feeds contain a summary of the content along with a link to the full article, making it easy for users to stay up-to-date with their favorite websites without having to visit them individually. Web developers can use RSS to syndicate their content and reach a wider audience, as well as provide a convenient way for users to consume their content.
