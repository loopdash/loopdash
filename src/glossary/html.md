HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of every website and is responsible for defining the structure and content of a webpage. HTML uses a series of tags to define the different elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to tell the web browser how to display the content of the webpage. HTML is a simple language to learn and is essential for anyone looking to create a website or work in web development.
