A dashboard is a web-based interface that provides users with a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important metrics. It is typically used by businesses and organizations to monitor and analyze data in real-time, allowing them to make informed decisions and take action based on the insights provided. Dashboards can be customized to display a wide range of data, including sales figures, website traffic, social media engagement, and more. They are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with interactive charts, graphs, and other visualizations that allow users to drill down into specific data points and explore trends over time. Overall, a dashboard is an essential tool for any web developer looking to create a data-driven website or application.
