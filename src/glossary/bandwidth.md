Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. It is typically measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second (Bps). Bandwidth is an important factor in determining the speed and efficiency of a website or online application. The higher the bandwidth, the faster the data can be transmitted, resulting in quicker load times and smoother user experiences. Bandwidth can be limited by various factors, such as network congestion, server capacity, and the type of connection being used. As a web developer, it is important to consider bandwidth when designing and optimizing websites to ensure that they are fast and responsive for users.
