An absolute path is a complete and specific file or directory location that starts from the root directory of a file system. It includes all the directories and subdirectories that lead to the file or directory in question. An absolute path is always the same, regardless of the current working directory or the user who is accessing the file. It is often used in programming and web development to specify the exact location of a file or directory, especially when working with multiple files or directories that have similar names. Absolute paths are essential for ensuring that files and directories are accessed correctly and consistently across different platforms and environments.
