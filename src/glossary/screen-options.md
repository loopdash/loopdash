Screen Options is a term used in web development that refers to a feature that allows users to customize the display of information on a particular screen. This feature is commonly found in content management systems (CMS) and allows users to choose which elements they want to see or hide on a particular page. For example, a user may choose to hide certain columns in a table or display additional fields in a form. Screen Options provide users with greater control over the information they see, making it easier to navigate and manage content. This feature is particularly useful for websites with a lot of data or complex layouts, as it allows users to tailor the display to their specific needs.
