A domain name is a unique identifier that is used to locate a website on the internet. It is a string of characters that is used to represent an IP address, which is a numerical address that identifies a specific computer or server on the internet. Domain names are used to make it easier for people to remember and access websites, as they are typically easier to remember than a string of numbers. They are also used to help organize and categorize websites, as they can be used to indicate the type of content or purpose of a website. Domain names are registered through domain name registrars, and can be purchased for a fee. Once a domain name is registered, it can be used to host a website, create email addresses, and more.
