A tag is a piece of code that is used to identify and define elements within an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to specify the type of content that is being displayed on a webpage. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text, while the <img> tag is used to display an image. Tags can also be used to add attributes to elements, such as the width and height of an image or the color of text. In addition, tags can be nested within each other to create more complex structures, such as tables or lists. Overall, tags are an essential component of HTML coding and are used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
