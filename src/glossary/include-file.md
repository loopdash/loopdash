An include file is a file that contains reusable code or content that can be included in multiple web pages or applications. It is a common practice in web development to use include files to avoid duplicating code and to make updates easier. For example, a website may have a header and footer that are consistent across all pages. Instead of copying and pasting the same code into every page, the header and footer can be stored in separate include files and included in each page using a server-side scripting language such as PHP. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures consistency and makes it easier to maintain the website.
