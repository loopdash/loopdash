Sanitization is a process of cleaning and filtering user input data to prevent malicious attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. It involves removing any potentially harmful characters or code from user input before it is processed by the application. Sanitization is an essential security measure that ensures the integrity and confidentiality of user data. It is typically implemented using a combination of server-side and client-side validation techniques, including regular expressions, input masks, and data type checks. By sanitizing user input, web developers can prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in their applications and protect their users from data theft and other cyber threats.
