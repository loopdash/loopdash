A Lightbox is a web development technique that allows users to view images or videos in a pop-up window that appears on top of the current page. This technique is used to enhance the user experience by providing a more interactive and engaging way to view media content. When a user clicks on an image or video, the Lightbox opens and dims the background, drawing the user's attention to the media content. The Lightbox can also include additional features such as zooming, scrolling, and sharing options. This technique is commonly used in e-commerce websites to showcase product images, in galleries to display artwork, and in portfolios to showcase photography and videography. Lightboxes are also mobile-friendly and responsive, making them accessible on all devices.
