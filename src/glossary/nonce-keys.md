Nonce keys are a type of cryptographic key used in web development to ensure the security of data transmission between a client and a server. A nonce key is a random number generated by the server and sent to the client as part of a request. The client then uses this key to encrypt the data it sends back to the server. The server can then decrypt the data using the same key, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. Nonce keys are used to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts and resends a previously sent message, by ensuring that each message is unique and can only be used once. Overall, nonce keys are an important tool in web development for ensuring the security and integrity of data transmission.
