Taxonomy refers to the process of categorizing and classifying data or information into specific groups or categories based on their characteristics, properties, and relationships. In web development, taxonomy is used to organize and structure content on a website, making it easier for users to navigate and find relevant information. Taxonomy can be applied to various types of content, including articles, products, images, and videos. It involves creating a hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories, assigning tags and labels to each item, and defining relationships between them. A well-designed taxonomy can improve the user experience, increase search engine visibility, and facilitate content management and maintenance.
