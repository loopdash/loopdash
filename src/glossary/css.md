CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation of a web page. It is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of a website. CSS works by separating the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing developers to create a consistent look and feel across multiple pages. It is a powerful tool that enables developers to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS is essential for creating modern, visually appealing websites that are easy to navigate and use. It is a fundamental skill for any web developer, and mastering it is crucial for creating high-quality web pages.
