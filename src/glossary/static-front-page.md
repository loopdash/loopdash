A static front page is a web page that remains unchanged until it is manually updated by the website owner or administrator. It is typically the first page that visitors see when they land on a website and serves as an introduction to the site's content. Static front pages are commonly used for websites that do not require frequent updates or changes, such as business websites or personal blogs. They are easy to create and maintain, and can be customized with images, text, and other design elements to create a visually appealing and informative landing page. Overall, a static front page provides a simple and straightforward way to present information to visitors and establish a strong online presence.
