Chmod is a command in Unix-based operating systems that stands for "change mode." It is used to change the permissions of files and directories, allowing or denying access to different users or groups. The chmod command uses a three-digit code to specify the permissions for the owner, group, and others. The first digit represents the owner's permissions, the second digit represents the group's permissions, and the third digit represents the permissions for all other users. Each digit is a sum of values that represent different permissions, such as read, write, and execute. Chmod is a powerful tool that allows web developers to control who can access and modify files on their servers, ensuring the security and integrity of their websites.
