An administrator is a person who is responsible for managing and overseeing the operations of a system or organization. In the context of web development, an administrator is typically responsible for managing the backend of a website or web application. This includes tasks such as managing user accounts, configuring security settings, monitoring system performance, and troubleshooting technical issues. Administrators may also be responsible for managing content and ensuring that it is up-to-date and relevant. In addition to technical skills, administrators must possess strong organizational and communication skills in order to effectively manage the various aspects of their role.
