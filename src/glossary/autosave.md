Autosave is a feature in web development that automatically saves changes made to a document or form without the need for manual intervention. This feature is particularly useful in situations where users may forget to save their work or experience unexpected interruptions such as power outages or internet connectivity issues. Autosave works by periodically saving changes made to a document or form in the background, ensuring that the latest version is always available. This feature is commonly used in web applications such as online editors, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms to provide a seamless user experience and prevent data loss. Autosave can be customized to suit specific requirements, such as the frequency of saving, the type of data being saved, and the storage location.
