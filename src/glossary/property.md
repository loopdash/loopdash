In web development, a property refers to a characteristic or attribute of an HTML element that can be modified or set using CSS. Properties can be used to control the appearance and behavior of elements on a web page, such as their size, color, position, and font. Each property has a specific syntax and value that can be adjusted to achieve the desired effect. For example, the "background-color" property can be used to set the background color of an element, while the "font-size" property can be used to adjust the size of the text within an element. Understanding how to use properties effectively is essential for creating visually appealing and functional web pages.
