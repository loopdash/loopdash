As a web developer, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between two different systems, enabling them to exchange data and functionality seamlessly. APIs are designed to simplify the development process by providing a standardized way for developers to access and manipulate data from other applications or services. They allow developers to create new applications or services that can leverage the functionality of existing systems, without having to build everything from scratch. APIs can be used to access a wide range of data, including text, images, videos, and more, making them an essential tool for modern web development.
