A CMS, or Content Management System, is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content, typically for websites. It provides a user-friendly interface that enables non-technical users to easily add, edit, and delete content without requiring any coding knowledge. CMSs typically include features such as templates, plugins, and modules that allow users to customize the look and functionality of their website. They also provide tools for managing user roles and permissions, tracking website analytics, and optimizing content for search engines. CMSs are widely used by businesses, organizations, and individuals to create and maintain websites, blogs, and online stores.
