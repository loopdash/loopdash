DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a crucial component of the internet infrastructure. It is a hierarchical naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites and other online resources using human-readable names instead of numerical IP addresses. DNS servers store and manage domain name records, which contain information about the corresponding IP addresses and other related data. When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address. The DNS server then responds with the IP address, allowing the browser to establish a connection with the web server hosting the requested website. DNS plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the internet and is essential for accessing online resources.
