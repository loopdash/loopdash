As a web developer, a template tag refers to a piece of code that is inserted into a template file to dynamically generate content on a web page. These tags are typically used in content management systems (CMS) to allow developers to create reusable code snippets that can be easily inserted into different pages or sections of a website. Template tags can be used to display dynamic content such as post titles, author names, or custom fields, and can also be used to control the layout and styling of a web page. By using template tags, developers can save time and effort by creating reusable code that can be easily modified and updated as needed.
