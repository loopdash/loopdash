A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content, such as text, images, videos, and audio files, on a website without requiring technical expertise. CMS provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to add, edit, and delete content, as well as customize the website's design and functionality. CMS also allows multiple users to collaborate on content creation and management, with different levels of access and permissions. CMS is essential for businesses and organizations that need to update their website frequently, as it streamlines the content creation and publishing process, improves website performance, and enhances the user experience. Popular CMS platforms include WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.
