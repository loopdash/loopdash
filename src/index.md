<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Why is a Loopdash website better than Wix or SquareSpace</h3>
<p class="text-base mb-5">Our custom websites are designed with your brand in mind and are capable of anything from custom searches to selling products. Custom sites also last longer, are more portable and are better for SEO. Custom sites end up paying for themselves.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Do I own my website once the project is finished?</h3>
<p class="text-base mb-5">Yes you do. You won't be locked into any contract once we launch your website. We do offer maintenance packages should you want some extra support after launching, but otherwise the site is yours.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
<p class="text-base mb-5">A new site is an investment for your brand. We offer financing that will allow you to get your website now and pay for it over a set period of manageable payments.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">How do I pay?</h3>
<p class="text-base mb-5">A 25% deposit is required prior to starting the project, with the balance being due upon project completion. We accept all major credit cards, Venmo, PayPal or check.</p>
