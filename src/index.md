## Why is a Loopdash website better than Wix or SquareSpace?

Our custom websites are designed with your brand in mind and
are capable of anything from custom searches to selling products.
Custom sites also last longer, are more portable and are better for
SEO. Custom sites end up paying for themselves.

## Do I own my website once the project is finished?

Yes you do. You won't be locked into any contract once we launch your website. We do offer maintenance packages should you want some extra support after launching, but otherwise the site is yours.

## Do you offer payment plans?

A new site is an investment for your brand. We offer financing that will allow you to get your website now and pay for it over a set period of manageable payments.

## How do I pay?

A 25% deposit is required prior to starting the project, with the balance being due upon project completion. We accept all major credit cards, Venmo, PayPal or check.
