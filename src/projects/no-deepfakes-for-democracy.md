  name: No Deepfakes for Democracy
  description: "Democracy relies on truth—but AI-driven disinformation is making it harder to tell what’s real. No Deepfakes for Democracy is fighting back. Backed by Accountable Tech, this initiative needed a platform that was as clear and urgent as its mission.
  <br/><br/> 
  We built a site that delivers the message without distraction. Strong. Direct. Unmistakable. Every element—typography, motion, structure—was crafted to inform and mobilize. This isn’t just a website; it’s a tool for action, built to hold Big Tech accountable.
  <br/><br/>
  Because trust in democracy shouldn’t be up for debate."
  tagline: Fighting deepfakes. Protecting truth.
