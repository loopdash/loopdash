We designed and developed katrina20.com in under three weeks—crafting a site that drives attendance, lifts up community stories, and amplifies the movement for racial, economic, and climate justice. From RSVP flows to storytelling, the site captures the urgency and heart of this annual remembrance."

      paragraph: The design of Katrina20.com draws inspiration from the resilience and cultural identity of New Orleans. We worked closely with the Hip Hop Caucus team to craft a visual language that honors the gravity of the anniversary while celebrating the community’s strength. The color palette evokes both remembrance and hope, while bold typography and dynamic layouts guide users through the story. Every design decision—from the prominence of the RSVP button to the flow of event details—was intentional, ensuring that the site feels both urgent and welcoming across devices.
