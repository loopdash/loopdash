  <h1 class="text-11 text-weight-400">Something Happened to Web Development.</h1>
  <p class="text-7">It used to be simple. If you needed a website, you worked with someone who built it. Someone who knew your business, who understood your goals, and who you could call when things needed to change. It felt like they were part of your team. And they were.</p>
  <p class="text-7">Today, that simplicity is gone. Most businesses are stuck choosing between two frustrating options:</p>
  <p class="text-7">- Traditional agencies that charge astronomical fees, overwhelm you with processes, and treat you like one of a dozen clients on their roster. Every email, every revision, every conversation feels like it’s on the clock.</p>
	<p class="text-7">- Freelancers who are affordable but unreliable, inconsistent, and impossible to scale with. When they disappear, so does your progress.</p>

<p class="text-7">The result? You’re spending more time managing them than managing your business.</p>

<p class="text-7">We think it’s time for something better.</p>
<h2 class="text-10">Introducing Us.</h2>
<p class="text-7">We’re a creative web development team that works like we’re part of your business — without the baggage of traditional agencies or the headaches of freelancers. For less than the cost of a single developer’s salary, we become your on-demand development, design, and SEO team.</p>

  <p class="text-7">Here’s why we’re different:</br>
	- No bloated fees. You pay one simple price for all the services you need: development, design, SEO, and more.</br>
	- No bottlenecks. We operate as an extension of your team, meaning you’ll never wait for “approval” or get lost in a bureaucratic workflow.</br>
	- No nickel-and-diming. Unlimited requests, quick turnarounds, and no hidden fees.</p>

  <p class="text-7">We don’t just want a project. We want a partnership.</p>

  <p class="text-7">What Does That Mean?<br>
	- We work alongside you to create, improve, and grow your digital presence over time.</br>
	- We’re invested in your success because your growth is our growth.</br>
	- And because we’re part of your team, you’ll always know who to call. No chasing down project managers or sending “urgent” support tickets into a black hole.</p>

The Truth About Agencies.
Agencies thrive on unpredictability. They charge extra for every change, pad timelines to justify inflated budgets, and keep you coming back for “add-ons” you didn’t know you’d need.

You deserve better.

With us, you get a team that’s always in your corner — working on your website, improving your SEO, creating new designs, and solving problems as they come up. No delays, no overcharging, no nonsense.

The Bottom Line.
For less than what you’d pay a single in-house developer, you get a complete team. No hiring, no training, no managing — just results.

The way agencies work is broken. We’re here to fix it.

Let’s build something great together.
