  <h1 class="text-weight-400 text-8">Something Happened to Web Development.</h1>
  <p>It used to feel personal. You worked with someone who knew your business, understood your goals, and built your website with care. They built your website like it was their own. They weren’t just a contractor — they were part of your team.
  </br></br>
  Today, web development has become a bloated, transactional mess. Agencies bury you in layers of project managers, inflated timelines, and surprise invoices. Freelancers? They’re affordable — until they disappear. Either way, you’re stuck juggling workflows, budgets, and unmet expectations while your website suffers.
  </br></br>
  We think it’s time to bring simplicity back.
  </br></br>
  We’re a creative web development team that works as an extension of your business. For less than the cost of a single developer — we handle all your development, design, and SEO needs. No surprise charges. No convoluted workflows. Just a reliable team working alongside you to create, maintain, and grow your digital presence.
  </br></br>
  We’re not interested in one-off projects. We prefer partnerships — relationships built on trust, consistency, and shared success. Think of us as your in-house team without the overhead, helping you avoid the pain points of traditional agencies or unreliable freelancers.
  </br></br>
  Web development doesn’t have to be complicated. Let’s simplify it together.
