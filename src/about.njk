  <h1 class="text-7 text-weight-400 mb-12 mt-24">Something Happened to Web Development.</h1>
  <p>
    It used to feel personal. You worked with someone who knew your business, understood your goals, and built your website like it was their own. They weren't just a contractor — they were part of your team.
    </br></br>
    But today, web development has become a bloated, transactional mess. Agencies bury you in layers of project managers, inflated timelines, and surprise invoices. Freelancers? They're affordable — until they disappear. Either way, you're stuck juggling workflows, budgets, and unmet expectations while your website suffers.
    </br></br>
    We think it's time to bring simplicity back.
    </br></br>
    We're a creative web development team that works as an extension of your business. For <span class="text-weight-600 text-6">less than the cost of a single developer</span> — we handle all your development, design, and SEO needs. No surprise charges. No convoluted workflows. Just a reliable team working alongside you to create, maintain, and grow your digital presence.
    </br></br>
    We're not interested in one-off projects. We prefer partnerships — relationships built on trust, consistency, and shared success. Think of us as your in-house team without the overhead, helping you avoid the pain points of traditional agencies or unreliable freelancers.
    </br></br>
    Web development doesn't have to be complicated. Let's simplify it together.
