At Loopdash, we don’t write applications we don't have to. It’s not because we don’t enjoy what we do, quite the opposite. But for us apps are a means to an end - a way to solve a problem. We've been around a while, so we have a few guidelines to ensure we leave things better than we found them.


### If a solution exists, we won’t rebuild it
Simply because there's no reason for us to. If we know of a SaaS product that solves 95% of the problem, we will tell you about it. Simple as that. We won’t rebuild our own version just because we can. And frankly, we think it’s bad business to even try.
  
  
### We try to not code
So before we do, we think of all other practical solutions. We're not lazy, we just act in our clients' best interest. That’s how we’ve always operated and how we always will.
  
  
### Is maintaining it worthwhile
We don't write code where the costs outweighs the value. We keep this top of mind throughout the project lifecycle.
